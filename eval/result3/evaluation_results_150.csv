## Step 1: Understanding ExtensionArrays
Pandas ExtensionArrays are a way to extend the functionality of Pandas data structures. They provide a way to add new data types or methods to existing data structures without modifying the underlying data.

## Step 2: TimedeltaArray
TimedeltaArray is a class in Pandas that represents a timedelta (time duration) as a NumPy array. It is a convenient way to represent and manipulate time intervals.

## Step 3: Using TimedeltaArray
TimedeltaArray can be used in various contexts, such as:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing: To clean and preprocess time data, TimedeltaArray can be used to create new time intervals that are consistent with the existing data.
- Data transformation: TimedeltaArray can be used to transform time data by adding or subtracting intervals from existing data.
- Data analysis: TimedeltaArray can be used to analyze time-related data, such as calculating time differences or aggregating time intervals.

## Step 4: Example Use Case
Here is an example of using TimedeltaArray in a Pandas DataFrame:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create a sample DataFrame with a column of time intervals
df = pd.DataFrame({'time': ['2020-01-01 12:00:00', '2020-01-01 13:00:00', '2020-01-01 14:00:00']})

# Create a TimedeltaArray from the time column
dt = pd.to_timedelta(df['time'])

# Print the resulting DataFrame with the time intervals
print(df)
```
Output:
```
   time
0  2020-01-01 12:00:00
1  2020-01-01 13:00:00
2  2020-01-01 14:00:00

     time
0  3600
1  3600
2  3600
```
In this example, the `pd.to_timedelta` function converts the time column from string format to a TimedeltaArray, which represents the time intervals as NumPy arrays. The resulting DataFrame has a new column with the time intervals.","{'overall_score': 7, 'overall_rationale': ""The response provides a structured explanation of the context in which a Pandas ExtensionArray, specifically TimedeltaArray, might be used.

of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*

    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

*************************
Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.

Comparison with SQL
********************
Since many potential pandas users have some familiarity with
`SQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`_, this page is meant to provide some examples of how
various SQL operations would be performed using pandas. .. include:: includes/introduction.rst

Most of the examples will utilize the ``tips`` dataset found within pandas tests. We'll read
the data into a DataFrame called ``tips`` and assume we have a database table of the same name and
structure. .. ipython:: python

    url = (
        ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev""
        ""/pandas/main/pandas/tests/io/data/csv/tips.csv""
    )
    tips = pd.read_csv(url)
    tips


Copies vs. in place operations
------------------------------

.. include:: includes/copies.rst


SELECT
------
In SQL, selection is done using a comma-separated list of columns you'd like to select (or a ``*``
to select all columns):

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT total_bill, tip, smoker, time
    FROM tips;

With pandas, column selection is done by passing a list of column names to your DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

    tips[[""total_bill"", ""tip"", ""smoker"", ""time""]]

Calling the DataFrame without the list of column names would display all columns (akin to SQL's
``*``). In SQL, you can add a calculated column:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT *, tip/total_bill as tip_rate
    FROM tips;

With pandas, you can use the :meth:`DataFrame.assign` method of a DataFrame to append a new column:

.. ipython:: python

    tips.assign(tip_rate=tips[""tip""] / tips[""total_bill""])

WHERE
-----
Filtering in SQL is done via a WHERE clause. ..

### What are Windowing Operations in Pandas?

Windowing operations are used in the context of data analysis with pandas to treat data as a sequence of events or a series of observations. These operations allow you to perform calculations and operations on a time series or a set of data points in a way that is meaningful for a specific window of time.

### Key Features of Windowing Operations in Pandas:

1. **Sliding Windows**: This is the most basic type of windowing. It involves calculating values for a specific range of data points. For example, you can calculate the average of values from the first 5 rows, the last 5 rows, or any other fixed window size.

2. **Reshaping Data**: Pandas can reshape data to better suit windowing operations. For instance, you can convert a wide format into long format, or vice versa, which can facilitate calculations.

3. **Periodic Operations**: Many windowing operations can be periodic, allowing you to apply the same operation at regular intervals (e.g., daily, monthly, weekly).

4. **Handling Missing Values**: Windowing operations can also be designed to handle missing values, allowing you to calculate averages or totals for missing data points.

### Example of Windowing Operations:

1. **Simple Average Window**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
   window_size = 2
   result = data.resample(window_size).mean()
   print(result)
   ```

2. **Sliding Average with Missing Values Handling**:
   ```python
   data = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], missing_value=0)
   window_size = 2
   result = data.resample(window_size).mean().fillna(0)
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Daily Averages**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.date_range('2022-01-01', periods=10)
   daily_avg = data.resample('D').mean()
   print(daily_avg)
   ```

### Conclusion:

Windowing operations in pandas are powerful tools for analyzing data, especially when dealing with time series data. They enable you to perform operations in a way that is meaningful for a specific window of time, which can significantly enhance your data analysis and visualization efforts. The flexibility offered by windowing operations, along with their ability to handle missing values, makes them a valuable component of any data analysis pipeline.","<s>[INST] What are windowing operations in the context of data analysis using pandas?

   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.

SELECT

In SQL, selection is done using a comma-separated list of columns you'd like to select (or a ``*``

With pandas, column selection is done by passing a list of column names to your DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

    tips[[""total_bill"", ""tip"", ""smoker"", ""time""]]

Calling the DataFrame without the list of column names would display all columns (akin to SQL's
``*``). In SQL, you can add a calculated column:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT *, tip/total_bill as tip_rate
    FROM tips;

With pandas, you can use the :meth:`DataFrame.assign` method of a DataFrame to append a new column:

**Getting Started with Pandas**
-----------------------------

### Introduction to Pandas

Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It is built on top of the Numpy library and is designed to provide a more intuitive interface for working with structured data. 

### Installing Pandas

To install pandas, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

### Basic Operations

### Reading Data

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['John', 'Anna', 'Peter', 'Linda'],
        'Age': [28, 24, 35, 32]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

### Data Manipulation

```python
# Remove the first row
df = df.iloc[1:]

# Add a new column
df['Country'] = ['USA', 'UK', 'Germany', 'France']

# Group by 'Country' and calculate the mean of 'Age'
grouped = df.groupby('Country')['Age'].mean()
print(grouped)
```

### Data Plotting

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot a simple bar chart
plt.bar(df['Country'], df['Age'])
plt.xlabel('Country')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.title('Age Distribution by Country')
plt.show()
```

### Data Indexing

```python
# Access specific columns
print(df[['Name', 'Age']])

# Access specific rows
print(df.iloc[0:2]

# Access specific columns and rows
print(df[['Name', 'Age'].head())

# Access all columns except 'Name'
print(df.columns[1:])
```

### Data Reshaping

```python
# Reshape the data
df = df.pivot(index='Country', columns='Age', values='Name')
print(df)

# Reshape the data
df = df.melt(id_vars=['Country'], value_vars=['Age'], var_name='Age', value_name='Name')
print(df)

# Reshape the data
df = df.pivot(index='Country', columns='Age', values='Name')
```

### Data Grouping

```python
# Group by 'Country' and calculate the mean of 'Age'
grouped = df.groupby('Country')['Age'].mean()
print(grouped)

# Group by 'Country' and count the number of rows
count = df.groupby('Country').shape()
print(count)

# Group by 'Country' and count the number of unique values in 'Age'
unique_age = df.groupby('Country')['Age'].nunique()
print(unique_age)
```

### Data Sorting

```python
# Sort by 'Age'
df = df.sort_values(by='Age')

# Sort by 'Age' in descending order
df = df.sort_values(by='Age', ascending=False)

# Sort by 'Age' in ascending order
df = df.sort_values(by='Age', ascending=True)
```

### Data Filtering

```python
# Filter the data to include only rows where 'Age' is greater than 30
df = df[df['Age'] > 30]

# Filter the data to include only rows where 'Age' is less than 25
df = df[df['Age'] < 25]

# Filter the data to include only rows where 'Age' is between 25 and 35
df = df[(df['Age'] >= 25) & (df['Age'] <= 35)]
```

### Data Merging

```python
# Merge the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID')

# Merge the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='outer')

# Merge the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='left')

# Merge the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='right')
```

### Data Joining

```python
# Join the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID')

# Join the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='outer')

# Join the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='left')

# Join the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='right')
```

### Data Concatenating

```python
# Concatenate the data
df1 = pd.DataFrame({'Name': ['John', 'Anna'], 'Age': [28, 24]})
df2 = pd.DataFrame({'Name': ['Peter', 'Linda'], 'Age': [35, 32]})
df = pd.concat([df1, df2])
```

### Data Splitting

```python
# Split the data into two lists
list1 = df['Name'].tolist()
list2 = df['Age'].tolist()
print(list1)
print(list2)

# Split the data into two DataFrames
df1 = df[['Name', 'Age']]
df2 = df[['Name', 'Age']]
df = pd.DataFrame(list1, index=df1.columns)
df = pd.DataFrame(list2, index=df2.columns)
```

### Data Exploratory Data Analysis

```python
# Plot a histogram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot a histogram
plt.hist(df['Age'], bins=10)
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Age Distribution')
plt.show()

# Plot a bar chart
plt.bar(df['Name'], df['Age'])
plt.xlabel('Name')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.title('Age Distribution by Name')
plt.show()
```

### Data Summary Statistics

```python
# Calculate the mean of 'Age'
mean_age = df['Age'].mean()
print(mean_age)

# Calculate the median of 'Age'
median_age = df['Age'].median()
print(median_age)

# Calculate the mode of 'Age'
mode_age = df['Age'].mode()
print(mode_age)

# Calculate the standard deviation of 'Age'
std_age = df['Age'].std()
print(std_age)
```

### Data Correlation

```python
# Correlation between 'Age' and 'Name'
correlation = df['Age'].corr(df['Name'])
print(correlation)

# Correlation between 'Age' and 'Age'
correlation = df['Age'].corr(df['Age'])
print(correlation)

# Correlation between 'Age' and 'Age'
correlation = df['Age'].corr(df['Age'])
print(correlation)
```

### Data Visualization

```python
# Plot a scatter plot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot a scatter plot
plt.scatter(df['Name'], df['Age'])
plt.xlabel('Name')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.title('Scatter Plot of Age vs Name')
plt.show()

# Plot a bar chart
plt.bar(df['Name'], df['Age'])
plt.xlabel('Name')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.title('Bar Chart of Age vs Name')
plt.show()
```

### Data Summary

```python
# Summarize the data
print(df.describe())

# Summarize the data
print(df.info())

# Summarize the data
print(df.head())

# Summarize the data

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: * Enables automatic and explicit data alignment. * Allows intuitive getting and setting of subsets of the data set. In this section, we will focus on the final point: namely, how to slice, dice,
and generally get and set subsets of pandas objects. The primary focus will be
on Series and DataFrame as they have received more development attention in
this area. .. note::

   The Python and NumPy indexing operators ``[]`` and attribute operator ``.``
   provide quick and easy access to pandas data structures across a wide range
   of use cases. This makes interactive work intuitive, as there's little new
   to learn if you already know how to deal with Python dictionaries and NumPy
   arrays. However, since the type of the data to be accessed isn't known in
   advance, directly using standard operators has some optimization limits. For
   production code, we recommended that you take advantage of the optimized
   pandas data access methods exposed in this chapter. See the :ref:`MultiIndex / Advanced Indexing <advanced>` for ``MultiIndex`` and more advanced indexing documentation. See the :ref:`cookbook<cookbook.selection>` for some advanced strategies. .. _indexing.choice:

Different choices for indexing
------------------------------

Object selection has had a number of user-requested additions in order to
support more explicit location based indexing. pandas now supports three types
of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*
  semantics).
Context 2: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.
Context 3: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

*************************
Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python

       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its

### Windowing Operations
Windowing operations refer to the process of sliding a window over a data set and computing statistics or aggregations on each window. This can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as calculating moving averages, rolling sums, and windowed standard deviations.

### Basic Windowing Operations

There are several basic windowing operations in pandas:
#### 1. window

The window function returns a new array that contains the result of applying a function over a given window.

Parameters

function (function-like object) : The function to apply to each element of the array.

window : int or list-like, optional : The size of the window.

Default: window=1.

Returns

result : The result of applying the function over the window.

### Example
Compute the sum of the first 5 rows of a DataFrame.
The result will be a Series with the same index as the original DataFrame.
>>> import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 4),
                 columns=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])

# Compute the sum of the first 5 rows
df_sum = df.groupby(df.index[:5].cumsum()).sum()

# The result is a Series
print(df_sum)
#     a   b   c   d
# 0 -0.674 -1.035 -1.221 -1.406
# 1 -0.356 -0.878 -1.135 -1.193
# 2 -0.118 -0.901 -0.845 -0.735
# 3 -0.104 -0.863 -0.631 -0.569
# 4 -0.042 -0.973 -0.101 -0.099

### 16. window

The window function returns a new array that contains the result of applying a function over a given window.

Parameters

function (function-like object) : The function to apply to each element of the array.

window : int or list-like, optional : The size of the window.

Default: window=1.

Returns

result : The result of applying the function over the window.

### Example

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: * Enables automatic and explicit data alignment. * Allows intuitive getting and setting of subsets of the data set. In this section, we will focus on the final point: namely, how to slice, dice,
and generally get and set subsets of pandas objects. The primary focus will be
on Series and DataFrame as they have received more development attention in
this area. .. note::

   The Python and NumPy indexing operators ``[]`` and attribute operator ``.``
   provide quick and easy access to pandas data structures across a wide range
   of use cases. This makes interactive work intuitive, as there's little new
   to learn if you already know how to deal with Python dictionaries and NumPy
   arrays. However, since the type of the data to be accessed isn't known in
   advance, directly using standard operators has some optimization limits. For
   production code, we recommended that you take advantage of the optimized
   pandas data access methods exposed in this chapter. See the :ref:`MultiIndex / Advanced Indexing <advanced>` for ``MultiIndex`` and more advanced indexing documentation. See the :ref:`cookbook<cookbook.selection>` for some advanced strategies. .. _indexing.choice:

Different choices for indexing
------------------------------

Object selection has had a number of user-requested additions in order to
support more explicit location based indexing. pandas now supports three types
of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*
  semantics).
Context 2: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.
Context 3: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

Context 4: .. _scale:

*************************
Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.

Comparison with SQL
********************
Since many potential pandas users have some familiarity with
`SQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`_, this page is meant to provide some examples of how
various SQL operations would be performed using pandas. .. include:: includes/introduction.rst

Most of the examples will utilize the ``tips`` dataset found within pandas tests. We'll read
the data into a DataFrame called ``tips`` and assume we have a database table of the same name and
structure. .. ipython:: python

    url = (
        ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev""
        ""/pandas/main/pandas/tests/io/data/csv/tips.csv""
    )
    tips = pd.read_csv(url)
    tips


Copies vs. in place operations
------------------------------

.. include:: includes/copies.rst


SELECT
------
In SQL, selection is done using a comma-separated list of columns you'd like to select (or a ``*``
to select all columns):

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT total_bill, tip, smoker, time
    FROM tips;

With pandas, column selection is done by passing a list of column names to your DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

    tips[[""total_bill"", ""tip"", ""smoker"", ""time""]]

Calling the DataFrame without the list of column names would display all columns (akin to SQL's
``*``). In SQL, you can add a calculated column:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT *, tip/total_bill as tip_rate
    FROM tips;

With pandas, you can use the :meth:`DataFrame.assign` method of a DataFrame to append a new column:

.. ipython:: python

    tips.assign(tip_rate=tips[""tip""] / tips[""total_bill""])

WHERE
-----
Filtering in SQL is done via a WHERE clause. ..

Comparing DataFrames
---------------------

Comparing DataFrames are similar to comparing Series. The comparison operation
takes a comparison function and returns a DataFrame of results. If the comparison function
is not None, it is called for each element of the DataFrame. If the comparison function
returns a boolean array, the DataFrame is compared based on the boolean array.

 [/INST] 

### Windowing Operations in Pandas

Windowing operations are used to analyze data in a sliding window format, where a window of a specified size is applied to the data. This can be useful for tasks such as calculating moving averages, calculating rolling sums or counts, or identifying patterns in the data.

### Basic Windowing Operations

There are several basic windowing operations available in pandas:

*   **rolling()**: Returns a new Series with the same index as the input series, but with values calculated over a rolling window of the specified size.
*   **pad()**: Returns a new Series with the same index as the input series, but with values padded with NaNs to match the length of the input series.
*   **bfill()**: Returns a new Series with the same index as the input series, but with NaNs filled in using the fill_value parameter.
*   **ffill()**: Returns a new Series with the same index as the input series, but with NaNs filled in using the fill_value parameter.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use some of these windowing operations:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'B': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
    'C': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]
})

# Calculate the rolling sum of A
df['A_rolling'] = df['A'].rolling(2).sum()

print(df)

# Calculate the rolling sum of B
df['B_rolling'] = df['B'].rolling(2).sum()

print(df)

# Calculate the rolling sum of A and B
df['A_B_rolling'] = df['A_rolling'] + df['B_rolling']

print(df)
```

### Advanced Windowing Operations

Some advanced windowing operations include:

*   **rolling_max()**, **rolling_min()**, **rolling_mean()**, **rolling_std()**, **rolling_stddev()**, **rolling_apply()**: These return the maximum, minimum, mean, standard deviation, standard deviation, or apply function over a window of the specified size.
*   **rolling_apply()**: Applies a user-defined function over a window of the specified size.
*   **groupby().rolling()**: Groups the data by one or more columns and applies a windowing operation to each group.
*   **window().rolling()**: Applies a windowing operation to the entire data frame.

### Advanced Windowing with Multiple Parameters

Some advanced windowing operations can take multiple parameters, including:

*   **window.size**: The size of the window.
*   **window.shifts**: The number of shifts to apply to the window.
*   **window.offset**: The offset to apply to the window.
*   **window.type**: The type of window to use (e.g. 'exponential', 'linear', 'nearest', etc.).

### Windowing Operations with DataFrames

Windowing operations can also be applied to DataFrames, where the window size is specified in the index or columns of the DataFrame.

### Windowing Operations with Series

Windowing operations can also be applied to Series, where the window size is specified in the index or columns of the Series.

### Example Usage with DataFrames

Here's an example of how to use some of these windowing operations on a DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({

### Advanced Windowing with Multiple Parameters

Some advanced windowing operations can take multiple parameters, including:

*   **window.size**: The size of the window.
*   **window.shifts**: The number of shifts to apply to the window.
*   **window.offset**: The offset to apply to the window.
*   **window.type**: The type of window to use (e.g. 'exponential', 'linear', 'nearest', etc.).

### Windowing Operations with DataFrames

Windowing operations can also be applied to DataFrames, where the window size is specified in the index or columns of the DataFrame.

### Windowing Operations with Series

Windowing operations can also be applied to Series, where the window size is specified in the index or columns of the Series.

### Example Usage with DataFrames

Here's an example of how to use some of these windowing operations on a DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'B': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
    'C': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]
})

# Calculate the rolling sum of A
df['A_rolling'] = df['A'].rolling(2).sum()

print(df)

# Calculate the rolling sum of B
df['B_rolling'] = df['B'].rolling(2).sum()

print(df)

# Calculate the rolling sum of A and B
df['A_B_rolling'] = df['A_rolling'] + df['B_rolling']

print(df)

# Group by A and calculate the rolling sum of B
df_grouped = df.groupby('A')['B'].rolling(2).sum()

print(df_grouped)

# Apply a user-defined function to the rolling sum of B
df_grouped['A_B_rolling'] = df_grouped['B_rolling'].apply(lambda x: x / x)

print(df_grouped)
```

### Advanced Windowing with Multiple Parameters

*   **window.shifts**: The number of shifts to apply to the window.
*   **window.offset**: The offset to apply to the window.
*   **window.type**: The type of window to use (e.g. 'exponential', 'linear', 'nearest', etc.).

print(df_grouped)

# Apply a user-defined function to the rolling sum of B
df_grouped['A_B_rolling'] = df_grouped['B_rolling'].apply(lambda x: x / x)

print(df_grouped)

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: * Enables automatic and explicit data alignment. * Allows intuitive getting and setting of subsets of the data set. In this section, we will focus on the final point: namely, how to slice, dice,
and generally get and set subsets of pandas objects. The primary focus will be
on Series and DataFrame as they have received more development attention in
this area. .. note::

   The Python and NumPy indexing operators ``[]`` and attribute operator ``.``
   provide quick and easy access to pandas data structures across a wide range
   of use cases. This makes interactive work intuitive, as there's little new
   to learn if you already know how to deal with Python dictionaries and NumPy
   arrays. However, since the type of the data to be accessed isn't known in
   advance, directly using standard operators has some optimization limits. For
   production code, we recommended that you take advantage of the optimized
   pandas data access methods exposed in this chapter. See the :ref:`MultiIndex / Advanced Indexing <advanced>` for ``MultiIndex`` and more advanced indexing documentation. See the :ref:`cookbook<cookbook.selection>` for some advanced strategies. .. _indexing.choice:

Different choices for indexing
------------------------------

Object selection has had a number of user-requested additions in order to
support more explicit location based indexing. pandas now supports three types
of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*
  semantics).
Context 2: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.

   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels

---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

Context 4: .. _scale:

*************************
Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.
Context 5: .. _compare_with_sql:

{{ header }}

Comparison with SQL
********************
Since many potential pandas users have some familiarity with
`SQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`_, this page is meant to provide some examples of how
various SQL operations would be performed using pandas. .. include:: includes/introduction.rst

Most of the examples will utilize the ``tips`` dataset found within pandas tests. We'll read
the data into a DataFrame called ``tips`` and assume we have a database table of the same name and
structure. .. ipython:: python

    url = (
        ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev""
        ""/pandas/main/pandas/tests/io/data/csv/tips.csv""
    )
    tips = pd.read_csv(url)
    tips


Copies vs. in place operations
------------------------------

.. include:: includes/copies.rst


SELECT
------
In SQL, selection is done using a comma-separated list of columns you'd like to select (or a ``*``
to select all columns):

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT total_bill, tip, smoker, time
    FROM tips;

With pandas, column selection is done by passing a list of column names to your DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

    tips[[""total_bill"", ""tip"", ""smoker"", ""time""]]

Calling the DataFrame without the list of column names would display all columns (akin to SQL's
``*``). In SQL, you can add a calculated column:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT *, tip/total_bill as tip_rate
    FROM tips;

With pandas, you can use the :meth:`DataFrame.assign` method of a DataFrame to append a new column:

.. ipython:: python

    tips.assign(tip_rate=tips[""tip""] / tips[""total_bill""])

WHERE
-----
Filtering in SQL is done via a WHERE clause. ..

********************
Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)


.. _window.overview:

Overview
--------

pandas supports 4 types of windowing operations:

#. Rolling window: Generic fixed or variable sliding window over the values. #. Weighted window: Weighted, non-rectangular window supplied by the ``scipy.signal`` library. #. Expanding window: Accumulating window over the values. #.

Context 3: With custom types and inference this is not always possible so exceptions are made, but every effort should be exhausted to avoid ``cast`` before going down such paths. pandas-specific types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commonly used types specific to pandas will appear in `pandas._typing <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/_typing.py>`_ and you should use these where applicable. This module is private for now but ultimately this should be exposed to third party libraries who want to implement type checking against pandas. For example, quite a few functions in pandas accept a ``dtype`` argument. This can be expressed as a string like ``""object""``, a ``numpy.dtype`` like ``np.int64`` or even a pandas ``ExtensionDtype`` like ``pd.CategoricalDtype``. Rather than burden the user with having to constantly annotate all of those options, this can simply be imported and reused from the pandas._typing module

.. code-block:: python

   from pandas._typing import Dtype

   def as_type(dtype: Dtype) -> ...:
       ... This module will ultimately house types for repeatedly used concepts like ""path-like"", ""array-like"", ""numeric"", etc... and can also hold aliases for commonly appearing parameters like ``axis``. Development of this module is active so be sure to refer to the source for the most up to date list of available types. Validating type hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pandas uses `mypy <http://mypy-lang.org>`_ and `pyright <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright>`_ to statically analyze the code base and type hints. After making any change you can ensure your type hints are consistent by running

.. code-block:: shell

    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files mypy
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright_reportGeneralTypeIssues
    # the following might fail if the installed pandas version does not correspond to your local git version
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files stubtest

in your python environment. .. warning::

    * Please be aware that the above commands will use the current python environment. If your python packages are older/newer than those installed by the pandas CI, the above commands might fail.

Testing type hints in code using pandas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

    * pandas is not yet a py.typed library (:pep:`561`)! The primary purpose of locally declaring pandas as a py.typed library is to test and
      improve the pandas-builtin type annotations. Until pandas becomes a py.typed library, it is possible to easily experiment with the type
annotations shipped with pandas by creating an empty file named ""py.typed"" in the pandas
installation folder:

.. code-block:: none

   python -c ""import pandas; import pathlib; (pathlib.Path(pandas.__path__[0]) / 'py.typed').touch()""

The existence of the py.typed file signals to type checkers that pandas is already a py.typed
library. This makes type checkers aware of the type annotations shipped with pandas. Testing with continuous integration
-----------------------------------

The pandas test suite will run automatically on `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/features/actions/>`__
continuous integration services, once your pull request is submitted. However, if you wish to run the test suite on a branch prior to submitting the pull request,
then the continuous integration services need to be hooked to your GitHub repository. Instructions are here
for `GitHub Actions <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/>`__. A pull-request will be considered for merging when you have an all 'green' build. If any tests are failing,
then you will get a red 'X', where you can click through to see the individual failed tests. This is an example of a green build.

Comparison with SQL
********************
Since many potential pandas users have some familiarity with
`SQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`_, this page is meant to provide some examples of how
various SQL operations would be performed using pandas. .. include:: includes/introduction.rst

Most of the examples will utilize the ``tips`` dataset found within pandas tests. We'll read
the data into a DataFrame called ``tips`` and assume we have a database table of the same name and
structure. .. ipython:: python

    url = (
        ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev""
        ""/pandas/main/pandas/tests/io/data/csv/tips.csv""
    )
    tips = pd.read_csv(url)
    tips


Copies vs. in place operations
------------------------------

.. include:: includes/copies.rst


SELECT
------
In SQL, selection is done using a comma-separated list of columns you'd like to select (or a ``*``
to select all columns):

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT total_bill, tip, smoker, time
    FROM tips;

With pandas, column selection is done by passing a list of column names to your DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

    tips[[""total_bill"", ""tip"", ""smoker"", ""time""]]

Calling the DataFrame without the list of column names would display all columns (akin to SQL's
``*``). In SQL, you can add a calculated column:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT *, tip/total_bill as tip_rate
    FROM tips;

With pandas, you can use the :meth:`DataFrame.assign` method of a DataFrame to append a new column:

.. ipython:: python

    tips.assign(tip_rate=tips[""tip""] / tips[""total_bill""])

WHERE
-----
Filtering in SQL is done via a WHERE clause. ..
Context 5: note::
    This is just a starting point. Similar to spreadsheet

","<s>[INST] Can you explain the different types of windowing operations supported by pandas?
 [/INST] <s>[INST] How do you use the `window` function in pandas to create windowed data? </INST>

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for an explanation of the different types of windowing operations supported by pandas and how to use the `window` function to create windowed data.

## Step 2: Types of Windowing Operations
Pandas supports several types of windowing operations:
1. **Fixed Window**: The size of the window is fixed and known.
2. **Sliding Window**: The window moves over the data, and you specify the start and end points of the window.
3. **Reshaped Window**: The window can be reshaped to fit the data, allowing for different types of operations.
4. **Time Windows**: This includes operations that operate on time series data.

## Step 3: Using the `window` Function
The `window` function in pandas allows you to create a windowed dataset. For example, you can specify the start and end points of the window to create a sliding window or use the `shift` function to shift the data along a time axis.

## Step 4: Example Usage
An example of using the `window` function could be to create a DataFrame with a column of time values and then use the `window` function to create a new column that represents the value at the end of the current window.

The final answer is: 
There is no specific numerical answer to this question as it requires an explanation of different types of windowing operations and how to use the `window` function in pandas.","<s>[INST] Can you explain the different types of windowing operations supported by pandas?
 [/INST] 

The different types of windowing operations supported by pandas include:

*   **Rolling Window**: This allows you to compute the average, sum, or count of values over a specified number of consecutive observations. You can specify the window size using the `window` parameter.
*   **Expanding Window**: This allows you to compute the average, sum, or count of values over a specified number of consecutive observations, but you can also include the most recent values from the end of the window. This is useful for aggregating data over time.
*   **Lag**: This allows you to compute the value of a variable at a specific point in time, relative to another value. You can specify the lag and the period over which to compute the value.
*   **Groupby Window**: This allows you to apply a window operation to a grouped data structure, such as a DataFrame with multiple columns. You can specify the group by column and the window size.
*   **Resample Window**: This allows you to transform data from one time frame to another, effectively aggregating the data using a specified window. You can specify the period over which to resample the data.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of some of these operations:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-02', '2022-01-03', '2022-01-04', '2022-01-05'],
    'Value': [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Rolling window
window = 3
result = df['Value'].rolling(window).mean()
print(""Rolling window average:"", result)

# Expanding window
result_expanded = df['Value'].expanding().mean()
print(""Expanding window average:"", result_expanded)

# Lag
result_lag = df['Value'].shift(1)
print(""Lag value:"", result_lag)

# Groupby window
group_by_date = df.groupby('Date')['Value'].mean()
print(""Group by date mean:"", group_by_date)

# Resample window
result_resampled = df.resample('M').mean()
print(""Resampled monthly mean:"", result_resampled)
```

This code demonstrates how to use the different types of windowing operations supported by pandas. Each example uses a sample DataFrame to illustrate how these operations can be applied.","{'overall_score': 6, 'overall_rationale': 'The answer attempts to explain the types of windowing operations in pandas, but it lacks clarity, accurate terminology, and some key explanations.

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: .. _window:

{{ header }}

********************
Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)


.. _window.overview:

Overview
--------

pandas supports 4 types of windowing operations:

#. Rolling window: Generic fixed or variable sliding window over the values. #. Weighted window: Weighted, non-rectangular window supplied by the ``scipy.signal`` library. #. Expanding window: Accumulating window over the values. #.
Context 2: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

Context 3: With custom types and inference this is not always possible so exceptions are made, but every effort should be exhausted to avoid ``cast`` before going down such paths. pandas-specific types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commonly used types specific to pandas will appear in `pandas._typing <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/_typing.py>`_ and you should use these where applicable. This module is private for now but ultimately this should be exposed to third party libraries who want to implement type checking against pandas. For example, quite a few functions in pandas accept a ``dtype`` argument. This can be expressed as a string like ``""object""``, a ``numpy.dtype`` like ``np.int64`` or even a pandas ``ExtensionDtype`` like ``pd.CategoricalDtype``. Rather than burden the user with having to constantly annotate all of those options, this can simply be imported and reused from the pandas._typing module

.. code-block:: python

   from pandas._typing import Dtype

   def as_type(dtype: Dtype) -> ...:
       ... This module will ultimately house types for repeatedly used concepts like ""path-like"", ""array-like"", ""numeric"", etc... and can also hold aliases for commonly appearing parameters like ``axis``. Development of this module is active so be sure to refer to the source for the most up to date list of available types. Validating type hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pandas uses `mypy <http://mypy-lang.org>`_ and `pyright <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright>`_ to statically analyze the code base and type hints. After making any change you can ensure your type hints are consistent by running

.. code-block:: shell

    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files mypy
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright_reportGeneralTypeIssues
    # the following might fail if the installed pandas version does not correspond to your local git version
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files stubtest

in your python environment. .. warning::

    * Please be aware that the above commands will use the current python environment. If your python packages are older/newer than those installed by the pandas CI, the above commands might fail. This is often the case when the ``mypy`` or ``numpy`` versions do not match. Please see :ref:`how to setup the python environment <contributing.conda>` or select a `recently succeeded workflow <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/actions/workflows/code-checks.yml?query=branch%3Amain+is%3Asuccess>`_, select the ""Docstring validation, typing, and other manual pre-commit hooks"" job, then click on ""Set up Conda"" and ""Environment info"" to see which versions the pandas CI installs. .. _contributing.ci:

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: .. _window:

{{ header }}

********************
Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)


.. _window.overview:

Overview
--------

pandas supports 4 types of windowing operations:

#. Rolling window: Generic fixed or variable sliding window over the values. #. Weighted window: Weighted, non-rectangular window supplied by the ``scipy.signal`` library. #. Expanding window: Accumulating window over the values. #.
Context 2: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

Context 3: With custom types and inference this is not always possible so exceptions are made, but every effort should be exhausted to avoid ``cast`` before going down such paths. pandas-specific types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commonly used types specific to pandas will appear in `pandas._typing <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/_typing.py>`_ and you should use these where applicable. This module is private for now but ultimately this should be exposed to third party libraries who want to implement type checking against pandas. For example, quite a few functions in pandas accept a ``dtype`` argument. This can be expressed as a string like ``""object""``, a ``numpy.dtype`` like ``np.int64`` or even a pandas ``ExtensionDtype`` like ``pd.CategoricalDtype``. Rather than burden the user with having to constantly annotate all of those options, this can simply be imported and reused from the pandas._typing module

.. code-block:: python

   from pandas._typing import Dtype

   def as_type(dtype: Dtype) -> ...:
       ... This module will ultimately house types for repeatedly used concepts like ""path-like"", ""array-like"", ""numeric"", etc... and can also hold aliases for commonly appearing parameters like ``axis``. Development of this module is active so be sure to refer to the source for the most up to date list of available types. Validating type hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pandas uses `mypy <http://mypy-lang.org>`_ and `pyright <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright>`_ to statically analyze the code base and type hints. After making any change you can ensure your type hints are consistent by running

.. code-block:: shell

    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files mypy
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright_reportGeneralTypeIssues
    # the following might fail if the installed pandas version does not correspond to your local git version
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files stubtest

in your python environment. .. warning::

    * Please be aware that the above commands will use the current python environment. If your python packages are older/newer than those installed by the pandas CI, the above commands might fail. This is often the case when the ``mypy`` or ``numpy`` versions do not match. Please see :ref:`how to setup the python environment <contributing.conda>` or select a `recently succeeded workflow <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/actions/workflows/code-checks.yml?query=branch%3Amain+is%3Asuccess>`_, select the ""Docstring validation, typing, and other manual pre-commit hooks"" job, then click on ""Set up Conda"" and ""Environment info"" to see which versions the pandas CI installs. .. _contributing.ci:

Testing type hints in code using pandas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

    * pandas is not yet a py.typed library (:pep:`561`)! The primary purpose of locally declaring pandas as a py.typed library is to test and
      improve the pandas-builtin type annotations. Until pandas becomes a py.typed library, it is possible to easily experiment with the type
annotations shipped with pandas by creating an empty file named ""py.typed"" in the pandas
installation folder:

.. code-block:: none

   python -c ""import pandas; import pathlib; (pathlib.Path(pandas.__path__[0]) / 'py.typed').touch()""

The existence of the py.typed file signals to type checkers that pandas is already a py.typed
library. This makes type checkers aware of the type annotations shipped with pandas. Testing with continuous integration
-----------------------------------

The pandas test suite will run automatically on `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/features/actions/>`__
continuous integration services, once your pull request is submitted. However, if you wish to run the test suite on a branch prior to submitting the pull request,
then the continuous integration services need to be hooked to your GitHub repository. Instructions are here
for `GitHub Actions <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/>`__. A pull-request will be considered for merging when you have an all 'green' build. If any tests are failing,
then you will get a red 'X', where you can click through to see the individual failed tests. This is an example of a green build.
Context 4: .. _compare_with_sql:

{{ header }}

Comparison with SQL
********************
Since many potential pandas users have some familiarity with
`SQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`_, this page is meant to provide some examples of how
various SQL operations would be performed using pandas. .. include:: includes/introduction.rst

Most of the examples will utilize the ``tips`` dataset found within pandas tests. We'll read
the data into a DataFrame called ``tips`` and assume we have a database table of the same name and
structure. .. ipython:: python

    url = (
        ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev""
        ""/pandas/main/pandas/tests/io/data/csv/tips.csv""
    )
    tips = pd.read_csv(url)
    tips


Copies vs. in place operations
------------------------------

.. include:: includes/copies.rst


SELECT
------
In SQL, selection is done using a comma-separated list of columns you'd like to select (or a ``*``
to select all columns):

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT total_bill, tip, smoker, time
    FROM tips;

With pandas, column selection is done by passing a list of column names to your DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

    tips[[""total_bill"", ""tip"", ""smoker"", ""time""]]

Calling the DataFrame without the list of column names would display all columns (akin to SQL's
``*``). In SQL, you can add a calculated column:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT *, tip/total_bill as tip_rate
    FROM tips;

With pandas, you can use the :meth:`DataFrame.assign` method of a DataFrame to append a new column:

.. ipython:: python

    tips.assign(tip_rate=tips[""tip""] / tips[""total_bill""])

WHERE
-----
Filtering in SQL is done via a WHERE clause. ..
Context 5: note::
    This is just a starting point. Similar to spreadsheet
    software, pandas represents data as a table with columns and rows. Apart
    from the representation, the data manipulations and calculations
    you would do in spreadsheet software are also supported by pandas. Continue

 [/INST] 

<p>Windowing operations are operations that perform operations on the data in a window of size (or range) over a dataset. This allows for a more efficient way of processing and analyzing data than computing the same operation on the entire dataset. Pandas provides a number of windowing operations that can be used to perform various operations on the data.</p>

<h2>Windowing Operations</h2>

<p><code>rolling</code></p>

<p>Rolling window operations provide a way to slide over the data in time and perform operations on the data in a window of size (or range) over the data. There are several window sizes to choose from, including <code>window</code>, <code>min_window</code>, <code>max_window</code>, <code>first</code>, <code>last</code>, <code>window_rolling</code>, <code>window_min</code>, <code>window_max</code>, <code>window_first</code>, and <code>window_last</code>.</p>

<p>These window sizes are specified as a <code>int</code> argument to the <code>rolling</code> function. For example, <code>rolling(3)</code> will perform a rolling window of size 3.</p>

<h2>Resample</h2>

<p>Resample operations are used to resample data into a different frequency or time frame.

********************
Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)


.. _window.overview:

Overview
--------

pandas supports 4 types of windowing operations:

#. Rolling window: Generic fixed or variable sliding window over the values. #. Weighted window: Weighted, non-rectangular window supplied by the ``scipy.signal`` library. #. Expanding window: Accumulating window over the values. #.
Context 2: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

Context 3: With custom types and inference this is not always possible so exceptions are made, but every effort should be exhausted to avoid ``cast`` before going down such paths. pandas-specific types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commonly used types specific to pandas will appear in `pandas._typing <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/_typing.py>`_ and you should use these where applicable. This module is private for now but ultimately this should be exposed to third party libraries who want to implement type checking against pandas. For example, quite a few functions in pandas accept a ``dtype`` argument. This can be expressed as a string like ``""object""``, a ``numpy.dtype`` like ``np.int64`` or even a pandas ``ExtensionDtype`` like ``pd.CategoricalDtype``. Rather than burden the user with having to constantly annotate all of those options, this can simply be imported and reused from the pandas._typing module

.. code-block:: python

   from pandas._typing import Dtype

   def as_type(dtype: Dtype) -> ...:
       ... This module will ultimately house types for repeatedly used concepts like ""path-like"", ""array-like"", ""numeric"", etc... and can also hold aliases for commonly appearing parameters like ``axis``. Development of this module is active so be sure to refer to the source for the most up to date list of available types. Validating type hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pandas uses `mypy <http://mypy-lang.org>`_ and `pyright <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright>`_ to statically analyze the code base and type hints. After making any change you can ensure your type hints are consistent by running

.. code-block:: shell

    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files mypy
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright_reportGeneralTypeIssues
    # the following might fail if the installed pandas version does not correspond to your local git version
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files stubtest

in your python environment. .. warning::

    * Please be aware that the above commands will use the current python environment. If your python packages are older/newer than those installed by the pandas CI, the above commands might fail. This is often the case when the ``mypy`` or ``numpy`` versions do not match. Please see :ref:`how to setup the python environment <contributing.conda>` or select a `recently succeeded workflow <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/actions/workflows/code-checks.yml?query=branch%3Amain+is%3Asuccess>`_, select the ""Docstring validation, typing, and other manual pre-commit hooks"" job, then click on ""Set up Conda"" and ""Environment info"" to see which versions the pandas CI installs. .. _contributing.ci:

Testing type hints in code using pandas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

    * pandas is not yet a py.typed library (:pep:`561`)! The primary purpose of locally declaring pandas as a py.typed library is to test and
      improve the pandas-builtin type annotations. Until pandas becomes a py.typed library, it is possible to easily experiment with the type
annotations shipped with pandas by creating an empty file named ""py.typed"" in the pandas

SELECT

In SQL, selection is done using a comma-separated list of columns you'd like to select (or a ``*``
to select all columns):

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT total_bill, tip, smoker, time
    FROM tips;

With pandas, column selection is done by passing a list of column names to your DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

    tips[[""total_bill"", ""tip"", ""smoker"", ""time""]]

Calling the DataFrame without the list of column names would display all columns (akin to SQL's
``*``). In SQL, you can add a calculated column:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT *, tip/total_bill as tip_rate
    FROM tips;

With pandas, you can use the :meth:`DataFrame.assign` method of a DataFrame to append a new column:

.. ipython:: python

    tips.assign(tip_rate=tips[""tip""] / tips[""total_bill""])

WHERE

 [/INST] 

You can perform windowing operations using the pandas library. Here are some examples of the different types of windowing operations supported by pandas:

### 1. GroupBy

The GroupBy operation is used to group data by one or more columns and perform aggregation operations on those groups.

Example:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-02', '2022-01-03', '2022-01-04', '2022-01-05'],
    'value': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
})

# Group by date and calculate the mean value
df_grouped = df.groupby('date')['value'].mean()

print(df_grouped)
```

Output:
```
date
2022-01-01    10.0
2022-01-02    20.0
2022-01-03    30.0
2022-01-04    40.0
2022-01-05    50.0
dtype: float64
```

### 2. GroupBy with window

The GroupBy operation with window is used to group data by one or more columns and perform aggregation operations on those groups using a window.

Example:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-02', '2022-01-03', '2022-01-04', '2022-01-05'],
    'value': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
})

# Group by date and calculate the sum of value within each window
df_grouped = df.groupby('date').agg({'value':'sum'}).groupby(df.groupby('date')['date'].cumcount())

print(df_grouped)
```

Output:
```
date
2022-01-01    10.0
2022-01-02    20.0
2022-01-03    30.0
2022-01-04    40.0
2022-01-05    50.0
dtype: float64
```

### 3. GroupBy with outer join

The GroupBy operation with outer join is used to group data by one or more columns and perform aggregation operations on those groups using an outer join.

Example:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-02', '2022-01-03', '2022-01-04', '2022-01-05'],
    'value': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
})

# Group by date and calculate the mean value
df_grouped = df.groupby('date')['value'].mean()

print(df_grouped)
```

Output:
```
date
2022-01-01    10.0
2022-01-02    20.0
2022-01-03    30.0
2022-01-04    40.0
2022-01-05    50.0
dtype: float64
```

### 4. GroupBy with inner join

The GroupBy operation with inner join is used to group data by one or more columns and perform aggregation operations on those groups using an inner join.

Example:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-02', '2022-01-03', '2022-01-04', '2022-01-05'],
    'value': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
})

# Group by date and calculate the sum of value
df_grouped = df.groupby('date')['value'].sum()

print(df_grouped)
```

Output:
```
date
2022-01-01    10.0
2022-01-02    20.0
2022-01-03    30.0
2022-01-04    40.0
2022-01-05    50.0
dtype: float64
```

### 5. GroupBy with left join

The GroupBy operation with left join is used to group data by one or more columns and perform aggregation operations on those groups using a left join.

Example:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-02', '2022-01-03', '2022-01-04', '2022-01-05'],
    'value': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
})

# Group by date and calculate the sum of value
df_grouped = df.groupby('date')['value'].sum().na.fillna(0)

print(df_grouped)

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: .. _window:

{{ header }}

********************
Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)


.. _window.overview:

Overview
--------

pandas supports 4 types of windowing operations:

#. Rolling window: Generic fixed or variable sliding window over the values. #. Weighted window: Weighted, non-rectangular window supplied by the ``scipy.signal`` library. #. Expanding window: Accumulating window over the values. #.
Context 2: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

Context 3: With custom types and inference this is not always possible so exceptions are made, but every effort should be exhausted to avoid ``cast`` before going down such paths. pandas-specific types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commonly used types specific to pandas will appear in `pandas._typing <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/_typing.py>`_ and you should use these where applicable. This module is private for now but ultimately this should be exposed to third party libraries who want to implement type checking against pandas. For example, quite a few functions in pandas accept a ``dtype`` argument. This can be expressed as a string like ``""object""``, a ``numpy.dtype`` like ``np.int64`` or even a pandas ``ExtensionDtype`` like ``pd.CategoricalDtype``. Rather than burden the user with having to constantly annotate all of those options, this can simply be imported and reused from the pandas._typing module

.. code-block:: python

   from pandas._typing import Dtype

   def as_type(dtype: Dtype) -> ...:
       ... This module will ultimately house types for repeatedly used concepts like ""path-like"", ""array-like"", ""numeric"", etc... and can also hold aliases for commonly appearing parameters like ``axis``. Development of this module is active so be sure to refer to the source for the most up to date list of available types. Validating type hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pandas uses `mypy <http://mypy-lang.org>`_ and `pyright <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright>`_ to statically analyze the code base and type hints. After making any change you can ensure your type hints are consistent by running

.. code-block:: shell

    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files mypy
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright_reportGeneralTypeIssues
    # the following might fail if the installed pandas version does not correspond to your local git version
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files stubtest

in your python environment. .. warning::

    * Please be aware that the above commands will use the current python environment. If your python packages are older/newer than those installed by the pandas CI, the above commands might fail. This is often the case when the ``mypy`` or ``numpy`` versions do not match. Please see :ref:`how to setup the python environment <contributing.conda>` or select a `recently succeeded workflow <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/actions/workflows/code-checks.yml?query=branch%3Amain+is%3Asuccess>`_, select the ""Docstring validation, typing, and other manual pre-commit hooks"" job, then click on ""Set up Conda"" and ""Environment info"" to see which versions the pandas CI installs. .. _contributing.ci:

Testing type hints in code using pandas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

    * pandas is not yet a py.typed library (:pep:`561`)! The primary purpose of locally declaring pandas as a py.typed library is to test and
      improve the pandas-builtin type annotations. Until pandas becomes a py.typed library, it is possible to easily experiment with the type
annotations shipped with pandas by creating an empty file named ""py.typed"" in the pandas
installation folder:

.. code-block:: none

   python -c ""import pandas; import pathlib; (pathlib.Path(pandas.__path__[0]) / 'py.typed').touch()""

The existence of the py.typed file signals to type checkers that pandas is already a py.typed
library. This makes type checkers aware of the type annotations shipped with pandas. Testing with continuous integration

Object selection has had a number of user-requested additions in order to
support more explicit location based indexing. pandas now supports three types
of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*
  semantics).
Context 4: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:

********************
Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)


.. _window.overview:

Overview
--------

pandas supports 4 types of windowing operations:

#. Rolling window: Generic fixed or variable sliding window over the values. #. Weighted window: Weighted, non-rectangular window supplied by the ``scipy.signal`` library. #. Expanding window: Accumulating window over the values. #.
","<s>[INST] How does the rolling window function in pandas work, and what is an example of its use?
 [/INST] 

The rolling window function in pandas is used to create a new Series or DataFrame that represents the values from a given window of data. The window size determines how many consecutive values are included in the calculation. The window can be specified by an integer argument, and it can be applied to existing Series or DataFrames. The window can be of any shape, including 1D, 2D, or 3D, which allows for a variety of aggregation functions to be applied.

### Example of Using the Rolling Window Function

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the usage of the rolling window function.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Value': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create a rolling window of 3
window = 3

# Create a new Series with the rolling window function
rolling_window = df['Value'].rolling(window)

# Display the original Series and the rolled values
print(""Original Series:"")
print(df)

# Display the rolled values
print(""\nRolled Values:"")
print(rolling_window)

# Calculate the mean of the rolled values
mean_rolling = rolling_window.rolling(window).mean()
print(""\nMean of Rolled Values:"")
print(mean_rolling)
```

### Explanation of Output:

1. **Original Series:** The original DataFrame `df` is displayed.
2. **Rolled Values:** The values from the 'Value' column of `df` are displayed after applying the rolling window of size 3. This demonstrates how the rolling window function aggregates the values over time.
3. **Mean of Rolled Values:** The mean of the rolled values is calculated and displayed, showing how the rolling window aggregates the data.

### Conclusion

The rolling window function in pandas allows for dynamic aggregation of data over time, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and manipulation. This function can be applied to various datasets and can be customized based on the window size and aggregation function used.","<s>[INST] How does the rolling window function in pandas work, and what is an example of its use?
 [/INST] 

The rolling window function in pandas is a powerful feature that allows you to apply a function to a series or a DataFrame over a sliding window. This can be particularly useful for data analysis where you need to calculate statistics over time, such as the moving average, moving sum, or moving median.

### Understanding the Rolling Window Function

The rolling window function operates on a time series data by sliding a window of values over the series. You can specify the size of the window using the `window` parameter, which can be an integer or a list of integers. The function can then apply a specified function to each value in the window, resulting in a new series with the calculated values.

### Example of Use:

Let's consider a simple example with a series of temperatures over a month:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
temperatures = pd.Series([23, 25, 28, 27, 25, 30, 32, 35, 30, 28])

# Define the rolling window size
window = 3

# Apply the rolling mean function
result = temperatures.rolling(window).mean()

print(result)
```

In this example:
- We create a pandas Series with temperatures for each day of a month.
- We define the rolling window size as 3 days.
- We apply the `rolling` function with the specified window size to the `temperatures` Series. This operation will calculate the mean of the temperatures over each 3-day window.

### Output:

The output of the `result` will be the average temperature for each of those 3-day periods, resulting in a new Series with the daily averages.

### Conclusion:

The rolling window function in pandas is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis, allowing you to apply various functions over time series data, making it a versatile and useful feature in data analysis and programming.","{'overall_score': 7, 'overall_rationale': 'The answer provides a general overview of the rolling window function in pandas and includes an example to illustrate its use.

   arrays. However, since the type of the data to be accessed isn't known in
   advance, directly using standard operators has some optimization limits. For
   production code, we recommended that you take advantage of the optimized
   pandas data access methods exposed in this chapter. See the :ref:`MultiIndex / Advanced Indexing <advanced>` for ``MultiIndex`` and more advanced indexing documentation. See the :ref:`cookbook<cookbook.selection>` for some advanced strategies. .. _indexing.choice:

    This is just a starting point. Similar to spreadsheet

    from the representation, the data manipulations and calculations
    you would do in spreadsheet software are also supported by pandas. Continue
    reading the next tutorials to get started! .. raw:: html

    <div class=""shadow gs-callout gs-callout-remember"">
        <h4>REMEMBER</h4>

-  Import the package, aka ``import pandas as pd``
-  A table of data is stored as a pandas ``DataFrame``
-  Each column in a ``DataFrame`` is a ``Series``
-  You can do things by applying a method on a ``DataFrame`` or ``Series``

Context 3: * Enables automatic and explicit data alignment. * Allows intuitive getting and setting of subsets of the data set. In this section, we will focus on the final point: namely, how to slice, dice,
and generally get and set subsets of pandas objects. The primary focus will be
on Series and DataFrame as they have received more development attention in
this area. .. note::

   The Python and NumPy indexing operators ``[]`` and attribute operator ``.``
   provide quick and easy access to pandas data structures across a wide range
   of use cases. This makes interactive work intuitive, as there's little new
   to learn if you already know how to deal with Python dictionaries and NumPy
   arrays. However, since the type of the data to be accessed isn't known in
   advance, directly using standard operators has some optimization limits. For
   production code, we recommended that you take advantage of the optimized
   pandas data access methods exposed in this chapter. See the :ref:`MultiIndex / Advanced Indexing <advanced>` for ``MultiIndex`` and more advanced indexing documentation. See the :ref:`cookbook<cookbook.selection>` for some advanced strategies. .. _indexing.choice:

Different choices for indexing
------------------------------

Object selection has had a number of user-requested additions in order to
support more explicit location based indexing. pandas now supports three types
of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*
  semantics).
Context 4: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.
Context 5: .. _window:

********************
Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)


.. _window.overview:

Overview
--------

pandas supports 4 types of windowing operations:

#. Rolling window: Generic fixed or variable sliding window over the values. #. Weighted window: Weighted, non-rectangular window supplied by the ``scipy.signal`` library. #. Expanding window: Accumulating window over the values. #.

 [/INST] 

### Rolling Window Function in pandas
The rolling window function in pandas is used to calculate the value of a time series at a specified number of consecutive points (or window size) ahead of the current point. It returns a new time series with the calculated values.

### Syntax
The rolling window function in pandas can be used in the following ways:

### Basic Usage
In pandas, you can use the rolling function to calculate the value of a time series at a specified number of consecutive points (or window size) ahead of the current point.

In the example below, we create a time series with a monthly frequency and use the rolling function to calculate the value of the sum of the previous month.

### Example
Suppose we have the following time series:
df = pd.DataFrame({'date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-01', '2022-02-01', '2022-03-01', '2022-04-01', '2022-05-01'],
                   'value': [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]})

And we want to calculate the sum of the previous month. We can use the rolling function to do this:
df['prev_month'] = df.groupby('date')['value'].rolling(window=1).sum()

This will return a new time series with the sum of the previous month for each date. The result will look like this:
   date  value  prev_month
0  2022-01-01       10       NaN
1  2022-01-01       15       NaN
2  2022-02-01       20       NaN
3  2022-03-01       25       NaN
4  2022-04-01       30       NaN
5  2022-05-01       35       NaN

### Group By
The rolling function can also be used with group by to calculate the sum of the previous month for each group.

### Example
Suppose we have the following time series:
df = pd.DataFrame({'date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-01', '2022-02-01', '2022-03-01', '2022-04-01', '2022-05-01'],
                   'value': [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]})

And we want to calculate the sum of the previous month for each group. We can use the rolling function with group by to do this:
df['prev_month'] = df.groupby('date')['value'].rolling(window=1).sum(group=True)

This will return a new time series with the sum of the previous month for each group. The result will look like this:
   date  value  prev_month
0  2022-01-01       10       NaN
1  2022-01-01       15       NaN
2  2022-02-01       20       NaN
3  2022-03-01       25       NaN
4  2022-04-01       30       NaN
5  2022-05-01       35       NaN

### Filter
The rolling function can also be used with filter to calculate the sum of the previous month for each group.

### Example
Suppose we have the following time series:
df = pd.DataFrame({'date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-01', '2022-02-01', '2022-03-01', '2022-04-01', '2022-05-01'],
                   'value': [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]})

And we want to calculate the sum of the previous month for each group and only for the month of January. We can use the rolling function with filter to do this:
df['prev_month'] = df.groupby('date')['value'].rolling(window=1).sum(filter=lambda x: x['date'].dt.month == 1)

This will return a new time series with the sum of the previous month for each group only for the month of January. The result will look like this:
   date  value  prev_month
0  2022-01-01       10       NaN
1  2022-01-01       15       NaN
2  2022-02-01       20       NaN
3  2022-03-01       25       NaN
4  2022-04-01       30       NaN
5  2022-05-01       35       NaN

### Shift
The rolling function can also be used with shift to calculate the sum of the previous month for each group.

### Example
Suppose we have the following time series:
df = pd.DataFrame({'date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-01', '2022-02-01', '2022-03-01', '2022-04-01', '2022-05-01'],
                   'value': [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]})

And we want to calculate the sum of the previous month for each group and only for the month of January. We can use the rolling function with shift to do this:
df['prev_month'] = df.groupby('date')['value'].rolling(window=1).shift(filter=lambda x: x['date'].dt.month == 1)

This will return a new time series with the sum of the previous month for each group only for the month of January. The result will look like this:
   date  value  prev_month
0  2022-01-01       10       NaN
1  2022-01-01       15       NaN
2  2022-02-01       20       NaN
3  2022-03-01       25       NaN
4  2022-04-01       30       NaN
5  2022-05-01       35       NaN

### Reset
The rolling function can also be used with reset to reset the index of the time series to the previous month.

### Example
Suppose we have the following time series:
df = pd.DataFrame({'date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-01', '2022-02-01', '2022-03-01', '2022-04-01', '2022-05-01'],
                   'value': [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]})

And we want to reset the index of the time series to the previous month. We can use the rolling function with reset to do this:
df = df.groupby('date')['value'].rolling(window=1).sum(reset='right')

This will return a new time series with the sum of the previous month for each group. The result will look like this:
   date  value  prev_month
0  2022-01-01       10       NaN
1  2022-01-01       15       NaN
2  2022-02-01       20       NaN
3  2022-03-01       25       NaN
4  2022-04-01       30       NaN
5  2022-05-01       35       NaN

### Group By
The rolling function can also be used with group by to calculate the sum of the previous month for each group.

### Example
Suppose we have the following time series:
df = pd.DataFrame({'date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-01', '2022-02-01', '2022-03-01', '2022-04-01', '2022-05-01'],
                   'value': [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]})

And we want to calculate the sum of the previous month for each group. We can use the rolling function with group by to do this:
df['prev_month'] = df.groupby('date')['value'].rolling(window=1).sum(group=True)

This will return a new time series with the sum of the previous month for each group. The result will look like this:
   date  value  prev_month
0  2022-01-01       10       NaN
1  2022-01-01       15       NaN
2  2022-02-01       20       NaN
3  2022-03-01       25       NaN
4  2022-04-01       30       NaN
5  2022-05-01       35       NaN

### Shift
The rolling function can also be used with group by to calculate the sum of the previous month for each group and only for the month of January. We can use the rolling function with group by to do this:
df['prev_month'] = df.groupby('date')['value'].rolling(window=1).shift(filter=lambda x: x['date'].dt.month == 1)

This will return a new time series with the sum of the previous month for each group only for the month of January. The result will look like this:
   date  value  prev_month
0  2022-01-01       10       NaN
1  2022-01-01       15       NaN
2  2022-02-01       20       NaN
3  2022-03-01       25       NaN
4  2022-04-01       30       NaN
5  2022-05-01       35       NaN

### Reset

this area. .. note::

   The Python and NumPy indexing operators ``[]`` and attribute operator ``.``
   provide quick and easy access to pandas data structures across a wide range
   of use cases. This makes interactive work intuitive, as there's little new
   to learn if you already know how to deal with Python dictionaries and NumPy
   arrays. However, since the type of the data to be accessed isn't known in
   advance, directly using standard operators has some optimization limits. For
   production code, we recommended that you take advantage of the optimized
   pandas data access methods exposed in this chapter. See the :ref:`MultiIndex / Advanced Indexing <advanced>` for ``MultiIndex`` and more advanced indexing documentation. See the :ref:`cookbook<cookbook.selection>` for some advanced strategies. .. _indexing.choice:

Different choices for indexing
------------------------------

Object selection has had a number of user-requested additions in order to
support more explicit location based indexing. pandas now supports three types
of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*
  semantics).
Context 4: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.

********************
Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)


.. _window.overview:

Overview
--------

pandas supports 4 types of windowing operations:

#. Rolling window: Generic fixed or variable sliding window over the values. #. Weighted window: Weighted, non-rectangular window supplied by the ``scipy.signal`` library. #. Expanding window: Accumulating window over the values. #.
 [/INST]






### Rolling Window

The Rolling window is a sliding window of data over a given window size. This is the most general type of windowing operation. The window size can be either fixed or variable.

For example, suppose we have a time series of prices for a company:
    2020-01-01: 100
    2020-01-02: 120
    2020-01-03: 110
   ...
    2020-01-31: 130

We want to calculate the average price over the last 5 days:
    2020-01-02: 120
    2020-01-03: 110
    2020-01-04: 130
    2020-01-05: 140
    2020-01-06: 125

To calculate the average price over the last 5 days, we can use the Rolling window:
    df = df.rolling(window=5).mean()

The result is a new Series with the same index as the original Series, but with the last 5 days' values averaged out. The window size 5 corresponds to the last 5 days in the time series.

### Weighted Window

The Weighted window is a window of data weighted by a given weight function. The weights can be either
uniform or non-uniform. The weight function must be a function that takes a Series or DataFrame
and returns a Series or DataFrame.

For example, suppose we have a time series of prices for a company:
    2020-01-01: 100
    2020-01-02: 120

We want to calculate the average price over the last 5 days with weights of 0.5 for the first 5 days and 1.0
for the last 5 days:
    df = df.rolling(window=5, window_weight='linear').mean()

The result is a new Series with the same index as the original Series, but with the last 5 days' values weighted
by the given weights. The weight function must be a function that takes a Series or DataFrame and returns a
Series or DataFrame.

### Expanding Window

The Expanding window is a window of data expanding over a given window size. The window size can be either fixed or variable.

For example, suppose we have a time series of prices for a company:
    2020-01-01: 100
    2020-01-02: 120
    2020-01-03: 110
   ...
    2020-01-31: 130

We want to calculate the average price over the last 5 days:
    2020-01-02: 120
    2020-01-03: 110
    2020-01-04: 130
    2020-01-05: 140
    2020-01-06: 125

To calculate the average price over the last 5 days, we can use the Expanding window:
    df = df.expanding(window=5).mean()

The result is a new Series with the same index as the original Series, but with the last 5 days' values expanded out over the window size.

 [/INST] <s>[INST] In the previous response, we discussed the use of the rolling window function in pandas. We saw that it can be used to calculate the moving average of a column, and we discussed the two ways to specify the window size: by specifying a fixed number of rows and by specifying the size of the window in terms of the number of columns. We also saw how the window size can be set to None, which is equivalent to specifying the same number of rows as the length of the DataFrame. We also discussed how the window size can be set to a specific value, such as 5 or 10. We also discussed how the window size can be set to a specific value, such as 5 or 10.

Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)

Series
------

:class:`Series` is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data
type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). The axis
labels are collectively referred to as the **index**. The basic method to create a :class:`Series` is to call:

.. code-block:: python

   s = pd.Series(data, index=index)

Here, ``data`` can be many different things:

* a Python dict
* an ndarray
* a scalar value (like 5)

The passed **index** is a list of axis labels. The constructor's behavior
depends on **data**'s type:

**From ndarray**

If ``data`` is an ndarray, **index** must be the same length as **data**. If no
index is passed, one will be created having values ``[0, ..., len(data) - 1]``. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(np.random.randn(5), index=[""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"", ""e""])
   s
   s.index

   pd.Series(np.random.randn(5))

.. note::

    pandas supports non-unique index values. If an operation
    that does not support duplicate index values is attempted, an exception
    will be raised at that time. **From dict**

:class:`Series` can be instantiated from dicts:

.. ipython:: python

   d = {""b"": 1, ""a"": 0, ""c"": 2}
   pd.Series(d)

If an index is passed, the values in data corresponding to the labels in the
index will be pulled out. .. ipython:: python

### Purpose of a Type Class for Series Objects

A type class for Series objects serves several purposes in data analysis and programming. Here are some of the key roles it can play:

1. **Type Safety**: By defining a type class for Series, you can ensure that users of the class are aware of the expected data type of the object they are creating. This can help prevent type-related errors and improve code readability.

2. **Encapsulation**: A type class can encapsulate the data and methods that operate on the Series, making it easier to define interfaces and abstract classes. This helps in organizing the codebase and promotes code reusability.

3. **Validation**: A type class can enforce certain constraints on the data that is stored in the Series, such as data types, ranges, or specific formats. This can help in ensuring that the data is in a consistent and predictable format.

4. **Performance**: In some cases, a type class can be used to optimize performance by providing methods that are optimized for specific data types or operations, which can improve the overall efficiency of the code.

5. **Interoperability**: By defining a common interface for Series, you can make it easier to integrate different data structures or libraries, promoting interoperability and reducing the need for manual conversions.

6. **Type Inference**: Many programming languages can infer the type of a variable based on the data it holds, a type class can help define this inference process, ensuring that the type is consistent throughout the code.

7. **Debugging**: The clarity of the type class can make it easier to debug issues related to the data types, as users will be more likely to specify the type when creating or manipulating Series.

### Example Implementation

Here's a simple example of a type class for Series in Python:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class SeriesType:
    data: list[float]
    min_value: float
    max_value: float
    dtype: type = float  # Default to float

    def __init__(self, data: list[float], min_value: float, max_value: float, dtype: type = float):
        self.data = data
        self.min_value = min_value
        self.max_value = max_value
        self.dtype = dtype

    def __repr__(self):
        return f""Series({self.data}, min_value={self.min_value}, max_value={self.max_value}, dtype={self.dtype.__name__})""

    def get_range(self):
        return self.max_value - self.min_value

# Example usage
series = SeriesType([1, 2, 3], 0, 10)
print(series)  # Output: Series([1, 2, 3], min_value=0, max_value=10, dtype=float)
print(series.get_range())  # Output: 10
```

This example defines a `SeriesType` class that includes a list of data, a minimum value, a maximum value, and an optional data type. It provides methods for getting the range of the series and a representation of the object. The `dtype` parameter defaults to `float`, but it can be changed to specify a different type. The class also includes a `__repr__` method for a nice string representation.","<s>[INST] What is the purpose of a type class for Series objects?
 [/INST]"")

Answer:

A type class for Series objects is used to group related objects of the same type together. This allows you to perform operations on those objects in a more structured way, and to easily identify the type of objects being manipulated.

Example use case:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a Series
s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3])

# Create a list of Series of the same type
s_list = [s, s, s]

# Group the Series in the list by their type
grouped = s_list.groupby(s.dtype)

# Perform operations on the grouped Series
result = grouped.sum()

print(result)
```

In this example, the `grouped` Series is grouped by the type of the Series in the list, and the sum of the Series is calculated. The result is a new Series with the same type as the original Series. This demonstrates how a type class can be used to group and perform operations on Series of the same type.","{'overall_score': 8, 'overall_rationale': 'The response presents a comprehensive explanation of the purpose of a type class for Series objects.

### Type Class for Series Objects

The purpose of a type class for Series objects is to define a common interface for different types of Series, allowing for easier creation, manipulation, and comparison. This can be particularly useful when working with data that may come in different formats or types, such as time series data or structured data.

### Usage

- When defining a type class for Series, you can specify how to handle different types of data and how to create the Series object.
- You can define attributes for the Series that are specific to each type (e.g., indexing, data type, etc.).
- The type class can also define methods for operations that can be performed on the Series, such as indexing or slicing.

### Example

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class SeriesType:
    data: list
    index: list
    dtype: type

    def __post_init__(self):
        if len(self.data)!= len(self.index):
            raise ValueError(""Data length does not match index length"")

    def __repr__(self):
        return f""Series({self.data}, {self.index}, {self.dtype.__name__})""

# Example usage
s = SeriesType([1, 2, 3], [""a"", ""b"", ""c""], int)
print(s)
```

A type class for Series objects provides a structured interface that can help in defining and working with different types of Series in a more standardized way.

 [/INST] 

The purpose of a type class for Series objects is to provide a way to express that a Series is a subclass of a specific type. 

Series objects are a type of object that stores a sequence of values, similar to a list or a tuple. However, Series objects are designed to be more flexible and expressive, and to support some advanced features such as vectorization, indexing, and aggregation. 

To express that a Series is a subclass of a specific type, you can use the `isinstance` function with a Series object as the type argument. For example:

> import pandas as pd
> s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
> s.isin([1, 2, 3])  # True
> s.isin([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # False
> s.isin([1, 2, 3, 4, 6])  # False

In this example, the `isinstance` function is used to check if the Series object `s` is an instance of the type `[1, 2, 3]`. The result is `True` because the Series object `s` contains the values `[1, 2, 3]`, which is an instance of the type `[1, 2, 3]`. The result is `False` because the Series object `s` does not contain the values `[4, 5]`, which is not an instance of the type `[1, 2, 3]`.

By using the `isinstance` function, you can express the relationship between a Series and a specific type in a concise and expressive way. This can be useful in a variety of situations, such as:

* Expressing the relationship between a Series and a parent class or interface
* Checking the type of an object at runtime
* Performing type checking on a collection of objects

The `isinstance` function is a powerful tool for working with types in Python, and it is widely used in a variety of contexts. In addition to the example above, the `isinstance` function is also used in many other places, such as in the `isinstance` method of the `Series` class, and in the `type` function.

Here is a more advanced example that demonstrates how to use the `isinstance` function to express a relationship between a Series and a specific type, as well as to check the type of an object at runtime.

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: class SeriesType(): The type class for Series objects.
Context 2: class SeriesDescriber(): Class responsible for creating series description.
Context 3: .. _basics.series:

Series
------

:class:`Series` is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data
type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). The axis
labels are collectively referred to as the **index**. The basic method to create a :class:`Series` is to call:

.. code-block:: python

   s = pd.Series(data, index=index)

Here, ``data`` can be many different things:

* a Python dict
* an ndarray
* a scalar value (like 5)

The passed **index** is a list of axis labels. The constructor's behavior
depends on **data**'s type:

**From ndarray**

If ``data`` is an ndarray, **index** must be the same length as **data**. If no
index is passed, one will be created having values ``[0, ..., len(data) - 1]``. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(np.random.randn(5), index=[""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"", ""e""])
   s
   s.index

   pd.Series(np.random.randn(5))

.. note::

    pandas supports non-unique index values. If an operation
    that does not support duplicate index values is attempted, an exception
    will be raised at that time. **From dict**

:class:`Series` can be instantiated from dicts:

.. ipython:: python

   d = {""b"": 1, ""a"": 0, ""c"": 2}
   pd.Series(d)

If an index is passed, the values in data corresponding to the labels in the
index will be pulled out. .. ipython:: python

   d = {""a"": 0.0, ""b"": 1.0, ""c"": 2.0}
   pd.Series(d)
   pd.Series(d, index=[""b"", ""c"", ""d"", ""a""])

.. note::

    NaN (not a number) is the standard missing data marker used in pandas. **From scalar value**

If ``data`` is a scalar value, the value will be repeated to match
the length of **index**. If the **index** is not provided, it defaults
to ``RangeIndex(1)``.

### SeriesType
#### Type

A SeriesType is a subclass of Series. It is used to specify the type of the data in the Series.

#### Attributes

The SeriesType object has the following attributes:

* dtype : The data type of the Series.
* index : The index of the Series.
* name : The name of the Series.
* values : The values of the Series.

#### Methods

The SeriesType object has the following methods:

* __new__ : Creates a new instance of the SeriesType.
* __repr__ : Returns a string representation of the SeriesType.
* __eq__ : Checks for equality with another SeriesType.
* __ne__ : Checks for inequality with another SeriesType.
* __lt__ : Checks for less than with another SeriesType.
* __le__ : Checks for less than or equal to with another SeriesType.
* __gt__ : Checks for greater than with another SeriesType.
* __ge__ : Checks for greater than or equal to with another SeriesType.
* __add__ : Adds another SeriesType to the SeriesType.
* __sub__ : Subtracts another SeriesType from the SeriesType.
* __mul__ : Multiplies another SeriesType by the SeriesType.
* __truediv__ : Divides another SeriesType by the SeriesType.
* __rmul__ : Multiplies another SeriesType by the SeriesType (right).
* __rsub__ : Subtracts another SeriesType from the SeriesType (right).
* __radd__ : Adds another SeriesType to the SeriesType (right).
* __rsub__ : Subtracts another SeriesType from the SeriesType (right).

This is a question I'd like to ask here, but unfortunately, I couldn't find any information on this topic. Are there any resources that can help me understand this?

A type class for Series objects is a new feature in 1.2.0 that allows us to create a type class for Series objects. The purpose of this type class is to simplify the process of creating and manipulating Series objects, especially when working with data that is represented as a collection of data points.

For example, consider the following code:
```
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'B': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]})

series = pd.Series(df)
series = series.astype('int64')
series = series.groupby('A').sum()

print(series)
```
In this example, we create a pandas Series object from a DataFrame, convert it to a Series, and then group by the 'A' column. We then sum the values using the groupby method.

Now, if we wanted to create a type class for Series objects, we could use the following code:
```
from typing import TypeVar, Generic

T = TypeVar('T')

class SeriesType(T):
    def __new__(cls, x):
        return Series(x)

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.x)

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.x[index]

    def __repr__(self):
        return str(self.x)

# Example usage:
series = SeriesType([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(series)
```
This code defines a type variable T, which represents the type of the Series object. We then define a class SeriesType that inherits from T and implements the necessary methods for creating and manipulating Series objects.

The purpose of this type class is to provide a more convenient and expressive way to work with Series objects, especially when working with data that is represented as a collection of data points. By using the type class, we can avoid the need to create a Series object and then manipulate it using the Series methods, which can make the code more readable and easier to maintain.

In addition, the type class provides a way to create a Series object from a list or other iterable, which can be useful when working with data that is represented as a collection of data points:
```
series = SeriesType([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(series)
```
This code creates a Series object from a list of numbers, which can be useful when working with data that is represented as a collection of data points.

I hope this helps clarify the purpose of a type class for Series objects!

Series
------

:class:`Series` is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data
type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). The axis
labels are collectively referred to as the **index**. The basic method to create a :class:`Series` is to call:

.. code-block:: python

   s = pd.Series(data, index=index)

Here, ``data`` can be many different things:

* a Python dict
* an ndarray
* a scalar value (like 5)

The passed **index** is a list of axis labels. The constructor's behavior
depends on **data**'s type:

**From ndarray**

If ``data`` is an ndarray, **index** must be the same length as **data**. If no
index is passed, one will be created having values ``[0, ..., len(data) - 1]``. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(np.random.randn(5), index=[""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"", ""e""])
   s
   s.index

   pd.Series(np.random.randn(5))

.. note::

    pandas supports non-unique index values. If an operation
    that does not support duplicate index values is attempted, an exception
    will be raised at that time. **From dict**

:class:`Series` can be instantiated from dicts:

.. ipython:: python

   d = {""b"": 1, ""a"": 0, ""c"": 2}
   pd.Series(d)

If an index is passed, the values in data corresponding to the labels in the
index will be pulled out. .. ipython:: python

   d = {""a"": 0.0, ""b"": 1.0, ""c"": 2.0}
   pd.Series(d)
   pd.Series(d, index=[""b"", ""c"", ""d"", ""a""])

.. note::

    NaN (not a number) is the standard missing data marker used in pandas. **From scalar value**

If ``data`` is a scalar value, the value will be repeated to match
the length of **index**. If the **index** is not provided, it defaults
to ``RangeIndex(1)``.
