Copy-on-Write (CoW)

    Copy-on-Write is now the default with pandas 3.0. Copy-on-Write was first introduced in version 1.5.0. Starting from version 2.0 most of the
optimizations that become possible through CoW are implemented and supported. All possible
optimizations are supported starting from pandas 2.1. CoW will lead to more predictable behavior since it is not possible to update more than
one object with one statement, e.g. indexing operations or methods won't have side-effects. Additionally, through
delaying copies as long as possible, the average performance and memory usage will improve. Previous behavior
-----------------

pandas indexing behavior is tricky to understand. Some operations return views while
other return copies. Depending on the result of the operation, mutating one object
might accidentally mutate another:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: df = pd.DataFrame({""foo"": [1, 2, 3], ""bar"": [4, 5, 6]})
    In [2]: subset = df[""foo""]
    In [3]: subset.iloc[0] = 100
    In [4]: df

       foo  bar

","<s>[INST] What is Copy-on-Write (CoW) and how does it affect the behavior of indexing operations in pandas?
 [/INST] 

### What is Copy-on-Write (CoW)?

Copy-on-Write is a concurrency control strategy used in databases and data storage systems. It is designed to ensure that changes to a database's data are reflected in all copies of the data as soon as the original data is updated. In the context of pandas, which is a popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis, Copy-on-Write is implemented to enable concurrent access to data while maintaining data integrity.

### How does it affect the behavior of indexing operations in pandas?

In pandas, when you perform an indexing operation (e.g., `df.loc[i, j]`), the operation does not immediately update the original data. Instead, it creates a copy of the data in memory. This copy is then updated in the `df` object. This behavior is known as ""Copy-on-Write"".

### Key implications:

1. **Performance**: The benefits of Copy-on-Write include faster performance since only one operation is needed to update the data in memory, whereas multiple operations would be required if no updates were made.
2. **Thread Safety**: The strategy ensures that all threads accessing the data are aware of each other's changes, maintaining consistency.
3. **Data Integrity**: Changes are propagated to all copies of the data, ensuring that the original data remains unchanged until the last update.

### Example Usage:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
data = {'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Perform an indexing operation
print(df.loc[0, 'A'))  # Output: 1
# Update the data in memory
df.loc[0, 'A'] = 10
print(df.loc[0, 'A'))  # Output: 10
```

In this example, the initial value of `A` in the DataFrame is changed, and then the same operation is performed on the original DataFrame, reflecting the updated value in memory. The final output demonstrates the integrity of the original data through the updated value in the DataFrame.","<s>[INST] What is Copy-on-Write (CoW) and how does it affect the behavior of indexing operations in pandas?
 [/INST] 

### What is Copy-on-Write (CoW)?

Copy-on-Write is a concurrency model used in databases and file systems. It allows multiple users to read from a shared resource without locking it, allowing one user to read while another user is still modifying the resource. The resource is considered ""read-only"" to the first user until another user makes changes to it, and then it becomes ""write-only"" to the second user until the first user makes changes.

### How does it affect the behavior of indexing operations in pandas?

In the context of pandas, Copy-on-Write (CoW) can affect the behavior of indexing operations in several ways:

1. **Read-Only Mode**: When pandas is in read-only mode (i.e., `mode='r'`), all operations, including indexing, will be read-only for the entire dataset. This means that any changes made to the data will not affect the original data, and you can read from the data without modifying it.

2. **Modifying while Reading**: If you modify the data while pandas is in read-only mode, you will still be able to read from it. However, any changes made to the data will be lost if you exit the read-only mode and re-enter it.

3. **Indexing**: When you index a DataFrame using `df.loc[]`, pandas will use the read-only mode by default. This means that any changes made to the data in the DataFrame will not affect the index, and you can read from the data as usual.

4. **Data Write**: If you write to a DataFrame using `df.to_csv()` or `df.to_excel()`, the changes will not affect the original data in memory. The changes are made to a new copy of the DataFrame, and the original data remains unchanged.

### Example Usage:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read-only mode
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv', mode='r')
print(data)

# Modify data while in read-only mode
data['new_column'] = [1, 2, 3]

# Read data again
new_data = pd.read_csv('data.csv', mode='r')
print(new_data)

# Write to a new DataFrame
new_df = pd.DataFrame({'new_key': [4, 5, 6]})
new_df.to_csv('new_data.csv', mode='w', index=False)
print(new_df)
```

### Conclusion:

Copy-on-Write (CoW) in pandas allows for efficient concurrent access to data while maintaining the integrity of the original data. It is particularly useful for data-intensive applications where frequent reads and writes are common. However, it requires careful handling of modes to ensure that the data remains readable while modifications are being made.","{'overall_score': 5, 'overall_rationale': ""The answer addresses both parts of the question but contains several inaccuracies and logical inconsistencies, especially regarding the implementation and implications of Copy-on-Write in pandas.

### Key Points

- **Copy-on-Write (CoW)**: In pandas 3.0, `copy` keyword is used to enable a lazy copy mechanism, which means that each operation will defer the creation of a copy until it is actually executed. This is useful for performance and memory efficiency.

- **Contexts**: The provided examples illustrate how `copy-on-write` affects the behavior of indexing operations, how it changes the behavior of `copy` methods, and how it impacts the creation of `DataFrame` and `Series` objects.

- **Advantages**: The benefits of `copy-on-write` include improved performance and memory usage, as it reduces the number of unnecessary copies of the data.

- **Limitations**: The use of `copy-on-write` may introduce some drawbacks, such as potential issues with updating the data in the original object and the limitations on the number of consecutive labels that can be filled in certain operations.

- **Future Developments**: As mentioned in the context, the use of `copy-on-write` will be deprecated in future versions of pandas, and the `copy` keyword will be replaced with a lazy copy mechanism. Users can opt-in to use the `copy_on_write` mode to leverage the benefits of lazy copying.

- **Use Cases**: The use of `copy-on-write` is particularly useful in scenarios where data is being modified and the need to ensure that the original data remains unchanged is crucial. Additionally, it may be beneficial in situations where the performance of the operations is critical.

- **Conclusion**: The concept of `copy-on-write` in pandas provides a way to optimize memory usage and improve performance by allowing lazy copying of data, which can be particularly useful in certain contexts. However, its limitations and potential drawbacks should be considered when deciding its use.","<s>[INST] What is Copy-on-Write (CoW) and how does it affect the behavior of indexing operations in pandas?

*******************
Copy-on-Write (CoW)
*******************

.. note::

    Copy-on-Write is now the default with pandas 3.0. Copy-on-Write was first introduced in version 1.5.0. Starting from version 2.0 most of the
optimizations that become possible through CoW are implemented and supported. All possible
optimizations are supported starting from pandas 2.1. CoW will lead to more predictable behavior since it is not possible to update more than
one object with one statement, e.g. indexing operations or methods won't have side-effects. Additionally, through
delaying copies as long as possible, the average performance and memory usage will improve. Previous behavior
-----------------

pandas indexing behavior is tricky to understand. Some operations return views while
other return copies. Depending on the result of the operation, mutating one object
might accidentally mutate another:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: df = pd.DataFrame({""foo"": [1, 2, 3], ""bar"": [4, 5, 6]})
    In [2]: subset = df[""foo""]
    In [3]: subset.iloc[0] = 100
    In [4]: df
    Out[4]:
       foo  bar
    0  100    4
    1    2    5
    2    3    6


Mutating ``subset``, e.g. updating its values, also updated ``df``.

        ignore the `copy` keyword. The `copy` keyword will be removed in a

limit : int, default None
    Maximum number of consecutive labels to fill for inexact matches. tolerance : optional
    Maximum distance between original and new labels for inexact
    matches. The values of the index at the matching locations must
    satisfy the equation ``abs(index[indexer] - target) <= tolerance``. Tolerance may be a scalar value, which applies the same tolerance
    to all values, or list-like, which applies variable tolerance per
    element. List-like includes list, tuple, array, Series, and must be
    the same size as the index and its dtype must exactly match the
    index's type. Returns
-------
Series or DataFrame
    Same type as caller, but with changed indices on each axis. See Also
--------
DataFrame.set_index : Set row labels. DataFrame.reset_index : Remove row labels or move them to new columns. DataFrame.reindex : Change to new indices or expand indices. Notes

inplace : bool, default False
    Modifies the object directly, instead of creating a new Series
    or DataFrame. Returns
-------
DataFrame, or None
    The same type as the caller or None if ``inplace=True``. See Also
--------
Series.rename : Alter Series index labels or name. DataFrame.rename : Alter DataFrame index labels or name. Index.rename : Set new names on index. Notes
-----
``DataFrame.rename_axis`` supports two calling conventions

* ``(index=index_mapper, columns=columns_mapper, ...)``
* ``(mapper, axis={'index', 'columns'}, ...)``

The first calling convention will only modify the names of
the index and/or the names of the Index object that is the columns. In this case, the parameter ``copy`` is ignored. The second calling convention will modify the names of the
corresponding index if mapper is a list or a scalar. However, if mapper is dict-like or a function, it will use the
deprecated behavior of modifying the axis *labels*. We *highly* recommend using keyword arguments to clarify your
intent.

### Answer within 400 words.

The `Copy-on-Write (CoW)` is a feature introduced in pandas 3.0 that allows for lazy copying of objects. This means that when you perform an operation like indexing or method calls on a DataFrame, pandas will not create a copy of the original DataFrame. Instead, it will return a view, which is an object that references the original data. This change is intended to improve performance and memory usage by reducing the number of copies that need to be made.

### Key Points:
- **Lazy Copying**: When you call `df.index` or `df.columns`, pandas returns a view instead of creating a copy.
- **Performance Benefits**: This change reduces memory usage and improves performance.
- **Future Improvements**: The `copy` keyword will be removed in a future version of pandas.

### Additional Contexts:
- The `copy` keyword has been deprecated since version 3.0.0 and will be removed in a future version.
- The `copy_on_write` feature is the default behavior in pandas 3.0. It is recommended to enable this feature to take advantage of the performance benefits.

### Conclusion:
The `copy_on_write` feature in pandas 3.0 introduces a lazy copying mechanism that reduces memory usage and improves performance by not creating unnecessary copies of the original DataFrame. This change is beneficial for operations that involve indexing or method calls on DataFrames, and it is recommended to use the `copy_on_write` feature in pandas 3.0 and beyond.

This change is intended to improve the performance and memory usage of operations involving indexing or method calls on DataFrames.

### Key Points:

- **Lazy Copying**: When you call `df.index` or `df.columns`, pandas returns a view instead of creating a copy.
- **Performance Benefits**: This change reduces memory usage and improves performance.
- **Future Improvements**: The `copy` keyword will be removed in a future version of pandas.

### Additional Contexts:

- The `copy` keyword has been deprecated since version 3.","{'overall_score': 7, 'overall_rationale': ""The answer provides an overview of Copy-on-Write (CoW) in pandas, its impact on indexing operations, and other related operations.

Copy-on-Write (CoW)
*******************

.. note::

    Copy-on-Write is now the default with pandas 3.0. Copy-on-Write was first introduced in version 1.5.0. Starting from version 2.0 most of the
optimizations that become possible through CoW are implemented and supported. All possible
optimizations are supported starting from pandas 2.1. CoW will lead to more predictable behavior since it is not possible to update more than
one object with one statement, e.g. indexing operations or methods won't have side-effects. Additionally, through
delaying copies as long as possible, the average performance and memory usage will improve. Previous behavior
-----------------

pandas indexing behavior is tricky to understand. Some operations return views while
other return copies. Depending on the result of the operation, mutating one object
might accidentally mutate another:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: df = pd.DataFrame({""foo"": [1, 2, 3], ""bar"": [4, 5, 6]})
    In [2]: subset = df[""foo""]
    In [3]: subset.iloc[0] = 100
    In [4]: df
    Out[4]:
       foo  bar
    0  100    4
    1    2    5
    2    3    6


Mutating ``subset``, e.g. updating its values, also updated ``df``.

 [/INST] 

### Changes Implemented in Pandas Versions 1.5.0, 2.0, and 2.1 Regarding Copy-on-Write

### 1. **Introduction to Copy-on-Write**

In Pandas 1.5.0, the introduction of `copy-on-write` was made, which allows certain operations on a DataFrame to be non-blocking. This feature is particularly useful for scenarios where data is being updated concurrently by multiple users, and you want to ensure that the update is not immediately visible to all users without an explicit request.

### 2. **Changes in DataFrame Operations**

- **Update of `update()` Method**: The `update()` method was modified to take a dictionary of updates instead of a list of updates. This change simplifies the way you can update a DataFrame, making it easier to manage data.
- **New `assign()` Method**: The `assign()` method was introduced, which allows you to create new columns or update existing ones in a DataFrame. This provides a more flexible way to manipulate data.

### 3. **Performance Improvements**

- **Optimized Memory Allocation**: The memory allocation for DataFrames was optimized, leading to faster performance in certain scenarios.
- **Improved Performance with `concat()`**: The `concat()` method now supports more efficient aggregation and grouping operations, improving overall performance in data manipulation tasks.

### 4. **New Functions and Methods**

- **`groupby()` and `aggregate()`**: New methods were introduced for grouping and aggregating DataFrames, enhancing the ability to perform complex operations on data.
- **`sort_values()`**: The `sort_values()` method now has a new option to sort by multiple columns, making it easier to select specific columns for sorting.

### 5. **Miscellaneous Changes**

- **Changes in Documentation**: There were updates to the documentation, including improved formatting and clearer explanations of various features.
- **Bug Fixes**: Various bugs were fixed, ensuring that Pandas functions behave as expected in different scenarios.

### Conclusion

The changes in Pandas versions 1.5.0, 2.0, and 2.1 regarding Copy-on-Write significantly enhance the capabilities of Pandas in terms of data manipulation and performance. The introduction of `copy-on-write` enables more flexible and concurrent data updates, while new functions and improvements in existing ones enhance the overall functionality of the library. These changes provide a solid foundation for further enhancements and support for advanced data manipulation tasks in Python.","<s>[INST] What changes were implemented in pandas versions 1.5.0, 2.0, and 2.1 regarding Copy-on-Write?
 [/INST] 

The answer is:

In pandas versions 1.5.0 and later, the `copy_on_write=True` parameter was removed from the `copy()` method, which means that any changes made to the DataFrame will not be saved in a new copy of the DataFrame. Instead, the original DataFrame is modified in place. This change was made to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

In pandas versions 2.0 and later, the `copy_on_write=False` parameter was introduced, which allows users to specify whether they want to create a new copy of the DataFrame if changes are made, or they want to modify the original DataFrame in place. This change was made to provide more flexibility and control over the behavior of the DataFrame.

In pandas versions 2.1 and later, the `copy_on_write` parameter was deprecated, and its behavior was changed to follow the `copy_on_write=False` behavior. This change was made to ensure that the `copy_on_write` parameter is deprecated and that users should use the `copy` method to create a new copy of the DataFrame if they want to avoid modifying the original DataFrame in place. 

Therefore, the changes implemented in the mentioned versions regarding Copy-on-Write were:

- In pandas versions 1.5.0 and later: The `copy_on_write=True` parameter is no longer supported, and any changes made to the DataFrame will be made in place.
- In pandas versions 2.0 and later: The `copy_on_write=False` parameter is introduced, allowing users to create a new copy of the DataFrame if they want to modify it in place.
- In pandas versions 2.1 and later: The `copy_on_write` parameter is deprecated and its behavior is changed to follow the `copy_on_write=False` behavior.","{'overall_score': 7, 'overall_rationale': ""The response provides a structured and detailed account of features related to Copy-on-Write in the specified pandas versions.

corresponding index if mapper is a list or a scalar. However, if mapper is dict-like or a function, it will use the
deprecated behavior of modifying the axis *labels*. We *highly* recommend using keyword arguments to clarify your

*******************
Copy-on-Write (CoW)
*******************

.. note::

    Copy-on-Write is now the default with pandas 3.0. Copy-on-Write was first introduced in version 1.5.0. Starting from version 2.0 most of the
optimizations that become possible through CoW are implemented and supported. All possible
optimizations are supported starting from pandas 2.1. CoW will lead to more predictable behavior since it is not possible to update more than
one object with one statement, e.g. indexing operations or methods won't have side-effects. Additionally, through
delaying copies as long as possible, the average performance and memory usage will improve. Previous behavior
-----------------

pandas indexing behavior is tricky to understand. Some operations return views while
other return copies. Depending on the result of the operation, mutating one object
might accidentally mutate another:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: df = pd.DataFrame({""foo"": [1, 2, 3], ""bar"": [4, 5, 6]})
    In [2]: subset = df[""foo""]
    In [3]: subset.iloc[0] = 100
    In [4]: df
    Out[4]:
       foo  bar
    0  100    4
    1    2    5
    2    3    6


Mutating ``subset``, e.g. updating its values, also updated ``df``.

        enabling copy on write ``pd.options.mode.copy_on_write = True``

    .. deprecated:: 3.0.0

Returns
-------
Series
    Series with index converted to PeriodIndex. See Also
--------
DataFrame.to_period: Equivalent method for DataFrame. Series.dt.to_period: Convert DateTime column values. Examples
--------
>>> idx = pd.DatetimeIndex([""2023"", ""2024"", ""2025""])
>>> s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=idx)
>>> s = s.to_period()
>>> s

limit : int, default None
    Maximum number of consecutive labels to fill for inexact matches. tolerance : optional
    Maximum distance between original and new labels for inexact
    matches. The values of the index at the matching locations must
    satisfy the equation ``abs(index[indexer] - target) <= tolerance``. Tolerance may be a scalar value, which applies the same tolerance
    to all values, or list-like, which applies variable tolerance per
    element. List-like includes list, tuple, array, Series, and must be
    the same size as the index and its dtype must exactly match the
    index's type. Returns
-------
Series or DataFrame
    Same type as caller, but with changed indices on each axis. See Also
--------
DataFrame.set_index : Set row labels. DataFrame.reset_index : Remove row labels or move them to new columns. DataFrame.reindex : Change to new indices or expand indices. Notes

inplace : bool, default False
    Modifies the object directly, instead of creating a new Series
    or DataFrame. Returns
-------
DataFrame, or None
    The same type as the caller or None if ``inplace=True``. See Also
--------
Series.rename : Alter Series index labels or name. DataFrame.rename : Alter DataFrame index labels or name. Index.rename : Set new names on index. Notes
-----
``DataFrame.rename_axis`` supports two calling conventions

* ``(index=index_mapper, columns=columns_mapper, ...)``
* ``(mapper, axis={'index', 'columns'}, ...)``

The first calling convention will only modify the names of
the index and/or the names of the Index object that is the columns. In this case, the parameter ``copy`` is ignored. The second calling convention will modify the names of the
corresponding index if mapper is a list or a scalar. However, if mapper is dict-like or a function, it will use the

almost every method returns a new object, leaving the original object
untouched. If the data is modified, it is because you did so explicitly. .. _basics.dtypes:

dtypes
------

For the most part, pandas uses NumPy arrays and dtypes for Series or individual
columns of a DataFrame. NumPy provides support for ``float``,
``int``, ``bool``, ``timedelta64[ns]`` and ``datetime64[ns]`` (note that NumPy
does not support timezone-aware datetimes). pandas and third-party libraries *extend* NumPy's type system in a few places. This section describes the extensions pandas has made internally. See :ref:`extending.extension-types` for how to write your own extension that
works with pandas. See `the ecosystem page <https://pandas.pydata.org/community/ecosystem.html>`_ for a list of third-party
libraries that have implemented an extension. The following table lists all of pandas extension types. For methods requiring ``dtype``
arguments, strings can be specified as indicated. See the respective

Context 5: .. _scale:

*************************
Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.
","<s>[INST] How can mutating a subset of a pandas DataFrame inadvertently affect the original DataFrame prior to the implementation of CoW?
 [/INST] 

### Explanation

The question explores the concept of CoW (Coercion Warning) in the context of mutating a subset of a pandas DataFrame. Coercion Warning is raised when trying to mutate a DataFrame that contains a subset of the original DataFrame, indicating that the operation could potentially alter the original DataFrame's data structure.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Understanding Coercion Warning**: The question starts by referencing the Coercion Warning, which is a built-in warning in Python that indicates that attempting to mutate a DataFrame that contains a subset of the original DataFrame could result in unexpected behavior.

2. **Mutating a Subset of a DataFrame**: The question specifically asks how mutating a subset of a DataFrame can inadvertently affect the original DataFrame before the implementation of CoW.

3. **Implications of CoW**: It then delves into the implications of CoW, highlighting that the warning is raised when the subset is not properly contained within the original DataFrame, which could lead to data loss or corruption.

4. **Example Context**: The question provides a context to understand that in a programming context, the warning might be triggered when a user attempts to modify a DataFrame that contains a smaller subset of the original data without ensuring that the smaller subset is also contained within the original DataFrame.

5. **Conclusion**: The question encourages the reader to think critically about the implications of manipulating subsets of DataFrames in a way that could lead to CoW warnings, emphasizing the importance of careful consideration when working with data.

### Code Example

Here's a simple example to illustrate the scenario:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
data = {
    'A': [1, 2, 3],
    'B': [4, 5, 6]
}
df_original = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create a subset of the DataFrame
subset = df_original[['A', 'B']]

# Attempt to mutate the subset (raises CoW warning)
try:
    subset[0] = 10  # This will raise a CoW warning
except CoWWarning:
    print(""CoW Warning raised: Attempting to mutate the subset of the original DataFrame."")

# Attempting to mutate the original DataFrame (no CoW warning)
df_mutation = df_original.copy()
df_mutation['C'] = 20
print(df_mutation)
```

This example demonstrates how the CoW warning can be triggered when trying to mutate a subset of a DataFrame without ensuring that the subset is contained within the original DataFrame.","<s>[INST] How can mutating a subset of a pandas DataFrame inadvertently affect the original DataFrame prior to the implementation of CoW?
 [/INST] 

The best answer is 4.  This question is referring to the concept of CoW (Change of Witness), which is a property of certain cryptographic protocols that allows a user to prove the existence of a specific value in a large database without actually having that value.

in this ``DataFrame`` are integers (``int64``), floats (``float64``) and
strings (``object``). .. note::
    When asking for the ``dtypes``, no parentheses ``()`` are used! ``dtypes`` is an attribute of a ``DataFrame`` and ``Series``. Attributes
    of a ``DataFrame`` or ``Series`` do not need ``()``. Attributes
    represent a characteristic of a ``DataFrame``/``Series``, whereas
    methods (which require parentheses ``()``) *do* something with the
    ``DataFrame``/``Series`` as introduced in the :ref:`first tutorial <10min_tut_01_tableoriented>`. .. raw:: html

My colleague requested the Titanic data as a spreadsheet. .. note::
    If you want to use :func:`~pandas.to_excel` and :func:`~pandas.read_excel`,
    you need to install an Excel reader as outlined in the
    :ref:`Excel files <install.excel_dependencies>` section of the
    installation documentation. .. ipython:: python

    titanic.to_excel(""titanic.xlsx"", sheet_name=""passengers"", index=False)

Whereas ``read_*`` functions are used to read data to pandas, the
``to_*`` methods are used to store data. The :meth:`~DataFrame.to_excel` method stores
the data as an excel file. In the example here, the ``sheet_name`` is
named *passengers* instead of the default *Sheet1*. By setting
``index=False`` the row index labels are not saved in the spreadsheet. .. raw:: html

        </li>
    </ul>

The equivalent read function :meth:`~DataFrame.read_excel` will reload the data to a
``DataFrame``:

.. ipython:: python

    titanic = pd.read_excel(""titanic.xlsx"", sheet_name=""passengers"")

.. ipython:: python

    titanic.head()

I’m interested in a technical summary of a ``DataFrame``

.. ipython:: python

    titanic.info()


The method :meth:`~DataFrame.info` provides technical information about a
``DataFrame``, so let’s explain the output in more detail:

-  It is indeed a :class:`DataFrame`. -  There are 891 entries, i.e.
Context 4: For example, there are only a
handful of ways to alter a DataFrame *in-place*:

* Inserting, deleting, or modifying a column. * Assigning to the ``index`` or ``columns`` attributes. * For homogeneous data, directly modifying the values via the ``values``
  attribute or advanced indexing. To be clear, no pandas method has the side effect of modifying your data;
almost every method returns a new object, leaving the original object
untouched. If the data is modified, it is because you did so explicitly. .. _basics.dtypes:

dtypes
------

For the most part, pandas uses NumPy arrays and dtypes for Series or individual
columns of a DataFrame. NumPy provides support for ``float``,
``int``, ``bool``, ``timedelta64[ns]`` and ``datetime64[ns]`` (note that NumPy
does not support timezone-aware datetimes). pandas and third-party libraries *extend* NumPy's type system in a few places. This section describes the extensions pandas has made internally. See :ref:`extending.extension-types` for how to write your own extension that
works with pandas. See `the ecosystem page <https://pandas.pydata.org/community/ecosystem.html>`_ for a list of third-party
libraries that have implemented an extension. The following table lists all of pandas extension types. For methods requiring ``dtype``
arguments, strings can be specified as indicated. See the respective
documentation sections for more on each type. +-------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+--------------------+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------+

pandas has two ways to store strings.
Context 5: .. _scale:

*************************
Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.
 [/INST]""""""

The final answer is: 

The question asked about how mutating a subset of a pandas DataFrame can affect the original DataFrame prior to the implementation of CoW (caching). The answer focuses on the difference in how the original and mutated DataFrames interact with the caching mechanism. The original DataFrame remains unchanged, while the mutated DataFrame is created by applying a function that may modify the data. This modification can be done without affecting the original DataFrame, as it is created in-place and retains its memory address. The mutated DataFrame, however, may be different and can be cached by the application, which can lead to changes in the original DataFrame's behavior if the cached data is used elsewhere. In summary, the original DataFrame remains unchanged, while the mutated one may have different characteristics and may be cached.","<s>[INST] How can mutating a subset of a pandas DataFrame inadvertently affect the original DataFrame prior to the implementation of CoW?
I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: By default, pandas will truncate output of large ``DataFrame``\s to show the first and last rows. This can be overridden by :ref:`changing the pandas options <options>`, or using
:meth:`DataFrame.head` or :meth:`DataFrame.tail`. ..
Context 2: pandas provides vectorized operations by specifying the individual ``Series`` in the
``DataFrame``. New columns can be assigned in the same way. The :meth:`DataFrame.drop` method drops
a column from the ``DataFrame``. ..
Context 3: raw:: html

        </li>
    </ul>

.. note::

    Interested in the last N rows instead? pandas also provides a
    :meth:`~DataFrame.tail` method. For example, ``titanic.tail(10)`` will return the last
    10 rows of the DataFrame. A check on how pandas interpreted each of the column data types can be
done by requesting the pandas ``dtypes`` attribute:

.. ipython:: python

    titanic.dtypes

For each of the columns, the used data type is enlisted. The data types
in this ``DataFrame`` are integers (``int64``), floats (``float64``) and
strings (``object``). .. note::
    When asking for the ``dtypes``, no parentheses ``()`` are used! ``dtypes`` is an attribute of a ``DataFrame`` and ``Series``. Attributes
    of a ``DataFrame`` or ``Series`` do not need ``()``. Attributes
    represent a characteristic of a ``DataFrame``/``Series``, whereas
    methods (which require parentheses ``()``) *do* something with the
    ``DataFrame``/``Series`` as introduced in the :ref:`first tutorial <10min_tut_01_tableoriented>`. .. raw:: html

Whereas ``read_*`` functions are used to read data to pandas, the
``to_*`` methods are used to store data. The :meth:`~DataFrame.to_excel` method stores
the data as an excel file. In the example here, the ``sheet_name`` is

Context 5: .. _scale:

*************************
Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.

**How can mutating a subset of a pandas DataFrame inadvertently affect the original DataFrame prior to the implementation of CoW?**
The mutation of a subset of a DataFrame can have unintended effects on the original DataFrame if the mutations are not properly handled or if the operations are not well-structured. For example, if you use the `drop` method to remove a subset of the DataFrame, you are modifying the original DataFrame directly. However, if you also try to mutate other parts of the DataFrame (e.g., using the `assign` method), you could end up with a new, modified DataFrame that is not the original. This could lead to unexpected results or data loss. Additionally, if you try to modify one part of the DataFrame and another part is modified independently, you might end up with inconsistent data. For instance, if you modify a subset of the DataFrame and then try to create a new DataFrame from the original, the modifications could be lost. This can happen if you use methods like `assign` or `update`, which can modify the original DataFrame directly. To avoid such issues, it's generally recommended to create a new DataFrame or use the `copy` method to avoid modifying the original. If you need to perform operations on the original DataFrame, consider using the `copy` method or creating a new DataFrame using the `DataFrame.copy()` method. This ensures that you can maintain the original data integrity. If you are working with large datasets, consider using the `chunk` approach to process the data in smaller pieces, which can help manage memory more effectively. **INST** 
**How can you check the data types of individual columns in a pandas DataFrame?**
You can check the data types of individual columns in a pandas DataFrame using the `dtypes` attribute. The `dtypes` attribute returns a dictionary that contains the data type of each column in the DataFrame. You can access the data types of specific columns using the column names or the `columns` attribute. For example: `ts.dtypes` will return the data type of each column in the `ts` DataFrame. **INST** 
**How can you ensure that a pandas DataFrame is coerced to a specific data type?**
You can coerce a pandas DataFrame to a specific data type by using the `astype()` method. The `astype()` method converts the entire DataFrame to a specified data type, which can be done by passing the desired data type as an argument. For example: `ts.astype(""int64"")` will convert the `ts` DataFrame to an integer data type. You can also use the `astype()` method to coerce specific columns or subsets of the DataFrame. For example: `ts[""name""].astype(""category"")` will convert the ""name"" column to a categorical data type. **INST** 
**How can you check the memory usage of a pandas DataFrame?**
You can check the memory usage of a pandas DataFrame using various methods. You can get the memory usage of the DataFrame in bytes by calling the `memory_usage()` method. You can also get the memory usage in human-readable format by calling the `memory_info()` method. For example: `ts.memory_usage()` will return the memory usage of the `ts` DataFrame in bytes. You can also use the `memory_info()` method to get the memory usage in a more human-readable format. For example: `ts.memory_info()` will return the memory usage in bytes. **INST** 
**How can you create a new DataFrame with a specific data type?**
You can create a new DataFrame with a specific data type by using the `DataFrame()` constructor and specifying the desired data type. You can also use the `copy()` method to create a new DataFrame from an existing DataFrame, and you can pass the desired data type as an argument. For example: `pd.DataFrame({""name"": [""John"", ""Mary""], ""age"": [25, 31]})` will create a new DataFrame with the specified data type. You can also use the `copy()` method: `ts_copy = ts.copy()` will create a new DataFrame with the same structure as the original `ts` DataFrame but with the desired data type. **INST** 
**How can you check the data types of individual columns in a pandas DataFrame using the `dtypes` attribute?**
You can check the data types of individual columns in a pandas DataFrame using the `dtypes` attribute.

For example: `ts_copy = ts.copy()` will create a new DataFrame with the same structure as the original `ts` DataFrame but with the desired data type.

Returning a Series to propagate names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Group DataFrame columns, compute a set of metrics and return a named Series. The Series name is used as the name for the column index. This is especially
useful in conjunction with reshaping operations such as stacking, in which the
column index name will be used as the name of the inserted column:

and ``reduce_C_function`` is a function of one argument that reduces all the
values in a bin to a single number (e.g. ``mean``, ``max``, ``sum``, ``std``). In this
example the positions are given by columns ``a`` and ``b``, while the value is
given by column ``z``. The bins are aggregated with NumPy's ``max`` function. .. ipython:: python

data using a variety of functions, including built-in, user-defined, and
optimized JIT-compiled functions. Parameters
----------
func : function, str, list, dict or None
    Function to use for aggregating the data. If a function, must either
    work when passed a Series or when passed to Series.apply. Accepted combinations are:

    - function
    - string function name
    - list of functions and/or function names, e.g. ``[np.sum, 'mean']``
    - None, in which case ``**kwargs`` are used with Named Aggregation. Here
      the output has one column for each element in ``**kwargs``. The name of
      the column is keyword, whereas the value determines the aggregation
      used to compute the values in the column. Can also accept a Numba JIT function with
      ``engine='numba'`` specified. Only passing a single function is supported
      with this engine. If the ``'numba'`` engine is chosen, the function must be
      a user defined function with ``values`` and ``index`` as the
      first and second arguments respectively in the function signature. Each group's index will be passed to the user defined function
      and optionally available for use.
","<s>[INST] What types of inputs can the reconstruct function accept for performing aggregations?
 [/INST] <s>[INST] What types of inputs can the reconstruct function accept for performing aggregations? </INST>

### Answer

The `reconstruct` function is primarily used for creating new objects based on existing ones, particularly when you need to transform data. However, it does not directly support performing aggregations. If you need to perform aggregations, you would typically use a library like `pandas` or another data manipulation tool that can handle such operations.

### Example with Pandas

For example, using Pandas, you can create a list of objects and then aggregate them using `groupby` and `agg`. Here's a simple example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a list of objects
objects = [
    {""name"": ""John"", ""age"": 25},
    {""name"": ""Alice"", ""age"": 30},
    {""name"": ""Bob"", ""age"": 35}
]

# Group the objects by name and calculate the sum of age
aggregated = [(name, sum(age) for name, age in objects)
             for name in objects]

# Reconstruct the original list with the aggregated data
reconstructed_list = [
    {""name"": name, ""age"": aggregated[0][1]}
    for name, aggregated in aggregated
]

# Print the reconstructed list
for item in reconstructed_list:
    print(item)
```

This code will output:

```
{'name': 'John', 'age': 25}
{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
{'name': 'Bob', 'age': 35}
```

### Conclusion

While `reconstruct` can be used for creating new objects, it is not designed to perform aggregations or manipulate data in the way you might need for such operations. For such tasks, you would generally use more specialized libraries or functions that support data manipulation and aggregation.","<s>[INST] What types of inputs can the reconstruct function accept for performing aggregations?
 [/INST] 

The `reconstruct` function can accept various types of inputs to perform aggregations. Here are some of the common types of inputs it can accept:

1. **DataFrames**: The function can accept any pandas DataFrame as an input. This allows for various types of aggregations that can be applied on the data.
2. **Series**: Similar to DataFrames, the function can also accept any pandas Series as an input, enabling a wide range of aggregation operations.
3. **Lists**: For simple aggregations, you can pass in a list of values or a list of Series, allowing for straightforward calculations.
4. **Data Structures**: Depending on the specific implementation, the function may accept other data structures such as NumPy arrays, which can also be used for aggregations.
5. **Custom Objects**: If you have defined a custom class that contains the data you want to aggregate, the function can accept instances of that class as well.

In summary, the `reconstruct` function is versatile and can handle various types of inputs, allowing for different aggregation strategies based on the input data type.

### Conclusion:

The `reconstruct` function provides flexibility in handling various input types, making it suitable for a wide range of data processing scenarios. The choice of input type depends on the specific requirements of your application.

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: def reconstruct_func(func): This is the internal function to reconstruct func given if there is relabeling
or not and also normalize the keyword to get new order of columns. If named aggregation is applied, `func` will be None, and kwargs contains the
column and aggregation function information to be parsed;
If named aggregation is not applied, `func` is either string (e.g. 'min') or
Callable, or list of them (e.g. ['min', np.max]), or the dictionary of column name
and str/Callable/list of them (e.g. {'A': 'min'}, or {'A': [np.min, lambda x: x]})

If relabeling is True, will return relabeling, reconstructed func, column
names, and the reconstructed order of columns. If relabeling is False, the columns and order will be None. Parameters

    If a list of functions is passed, the resulting pivot table will have
    hierarchical columns whose top level are the function names
    (inferred from the function objects themselves). If a dict is passed, the key is column to aggregate and the value is
    function or list of functions. If ``margins=True``, aggfunc will be
    used to calculate the partial aggregates. fill_value : scalar, default None
    Value to replace missing values with (in the resulting pivot table,
    after aggregation). margins : bool, default False
    If ``margins=True``, special ``All`` columns and rows
    will be added with partial group aggregates across the categories
    on the rows and columns. dropna : bool, default True
    Do not include columns whose entries are all NaN. If True,
    rows with a NaN value in any column will be omitted before
    computing margins. margins_name : str, default 'All'
    Name of the row / column that will contain the totals
    when margins is True. observed : bool, default False
    This only applies if any of the groupers are Categoricals. If True: only show observed values for categorical groupers. If False: show all values for categorical groupers. .. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

   The example below shows how we can downsample by consolidation of samples into fewer ones. Here by using **df.index // 5**, we are aggregating the samples in bins. By applying **std()**

Returning a Series to propagate names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Group DataFrame columns, compute a set of metrics and return a named Series. The Series name is used as the name for the column index. This is especially
useful in conjunction with reshaping operations such as stacking, in which the
column index name will be used as the name of the inserted column:

.. ipython:: python

   df = pd.DataFrame(
       {
           ""a"": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2],
           ""b"": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
           ""c"": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
           ""d"": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       }
   )

   def compute_metrics(x):
       result = {""b_sum"": x[""b""].sum(), ""c_mean"": x[""c""].mean()}
       return pd.Series(result, name=""metrics"")

   result = df.groupby(""a"").apply(compute_metrics, include_groups=False)

   result

   result.stack()

Context 4: By default, a histogram of the counts around each ``(x, y)`` point is computed. You can specify alternative aggregations by passing values to the ``C`` and
``reduce_C_function`` arguments. ``C`` specifies the value at each ``(x, y)`` point
and ``reduce_C_function`` is a function of one argument that reduces all the
values in a bin to a single number (e.g. ``mean``, ``max``, ``sum``, ``std``). In this
example the positions are given by columns ``a`` and ``b``, while the value is
given by column ``z``. The bins are aggregated with NumPy's ``max`` function. .. ipython:: python

You can create a pie plot with :meth:`DataFrame.plot.pie` or :meth:`Series.plot.pie`. If your data includes any ``NaN``, they will be automatically filled with 0.
Context 5: def aggregate(self, func): Aggregate using one or more operations. The ``aggregate`` method enables flexible and efficient aggregation of grouped
data using a variety of functions, including built-in, user-defined, and
optimized JIT-compiled functions. Parameters
----------
func : function, str, list, dict or None
    Function to use for aggregating the data. If a function, must either
    work when passed a Series or when passed to Series.apply. Accepted combinations are:

    - function
    - string function name
    - list of functions and/or function names, e.g. ``[np.sum, 'mean']``
    - None, in which case ``**kwargs`` are used with Named Aggregation. Here
      the output has one column for each element in ``**kwargs``. The name of
      the column is keyword, whereas the value determines the aggregation
      used to compute the values in the column. Can also accept a Numba JIT function with
      ``engine='numba'`` specified. Only passing a single function is supported
      with this engine. If the ``'numba'`` engine is chosen, the function must be
      a user defined function with ``values`` and ``index`` as the
      first and second arguments respectively in the function signature. Each group's index will be passed to the user defined function
      and optionally available for use.

"What happens when named aggregation is applied in the context of the reconstruction process?
",False,2.0,"Context 1: When an aggregation method is provided, the result
will be broadcast across the group.
Context 2: This provides a useful syntax for constructing multiple
(potentially different) aggregations. However, ``.agg(..)`` can *also* accept a dict that allows 'renaming' of the result columns. This is a complicated and confusing syntax, as well as not consistent
between ``Series`` and ``DataFrame``. We are deprecating this 'renaming' functionality. - We are deprecating passing a dict to a grouped/rolled/resampled ``Series``. This allowed
  one to ``rename`` the resulting aggregation, but this had a completely different
  meaning than passing a dictionary to a grouped ``DataFrame``, which accepts column-to-aggregations. - We are deprecating passing a dict-of-dicts to a grouped/rolled/resampled ``DataFrame`` in a similar manner. This is an illustrative example:

.. ipython:: python

   df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 1, 1, 2, 2],
                      'B': range(5),
                      'C': range(5)})
   df

Here is a typical useful syntax for computing different aggregations for different columns. This
is a natural, and useful syntax. We aggregate from the dict-to-list by taking the specified
columns and applying the list of functions. This returns a ``MultiIndex`` for the columns (this is *not* deprecated). .. ipython:: python

   df.groupby('A').agg({'B': 'sum', 'C': 'min'})

Here's an example of the first deprecation, passing a dict to a grouped ``Series``. This
is a combination aggregation & renaming:

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [6]: df.groupby('A').B.agg({'foo': 'count'})
   FutureWarning: using a dict on a Series for aggregation
   is deprecated and will be removed in a future version

   Out[6]:
      foo
   A
   1    3
   2    2

You can accomplish the same operation, more idiomatically by:

.. ipython:: python

   df.groupby('A').B.agg(['count']).rename(columns={'count': 'foo'})


Here's an example of the second deprecation, passing a dict-of-dict to a grouped ``DataFrame``:

.. code-block:: python

   In [23]: (df.groupby('A')
       ...:    .agg({'B': {'foo': 'sum'}, 'C': {'bar': 'min'}})

   Out[23]:
        B   C
      foo bar
   A
   1   3   0
   2   7   3


You can accomplish nearly the same by:

.. ipython:: python

   (df.groupby('A')
      .agg({'B': 'sum', 'C': 'min'})
      .rename(columns={'B': 'foo', 'C': 'bar'})

   grouped = df.groupby(""A"")
   grouped[[""C"", ""D""]].aggregate(""sum"")

   grouped = df.groupby([""A"", ""B""])

The result of the aggregation will have the group names as the
new index. In the case of multiple keys, the result is a
:ref:`MultiIndex <advanced.hierarchical>` by default. As mentioned above, this can be
changed by using the ``as_index`` option:

.. ipython:: python

   grouped = df.groupby([""A"", ""B""], as_index=False)
   grouped.agg(""sum"")

   df.groupby(""A"", as_index=False)[[""C"", ""D""]].agg(""sum"")

Note that you could use the :meth:`DataFrame.reset_index` DataFrame function to achieve
the same result as the column names are stored in the resulting ``MultiIndex``, although
this will make an extra copy. .. ipython:: python

   df.groupby([""A"", ""B""]).agg(""sum"").reset_index()

.. _groupby.aggregate.udf:

Aggregation with user-defined functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can also provide their own User-Defined Functions (UDFs) for custom aggregations. .. warning::

    When aggregating with a UDF, the UDF should not mutate the
    provided ``Series``. See :ref:`gotchas.udf-mutation` for more information. .. note::

    Aggregating with a UDF is often less performant than using
    the pandas built-in methods on GroupBy. Consider breaking up a complex operation
    into a chain of operations that utilize the built-in methods. .. ipython:: python

   animals
   animals.groupby(""kind"")[[""height""]].agg(lambda x: set(x))

The resulting dtype will reflect that of the aggregating function. If the results from different groups have
different dtypes, then a common dtype will be determined in the same way as ``DataFrame`` construction. .. ipython:: python

   animals.groupby(""kind"")[[""height""]].agg(lambda x: x.astype(int).sum())

.. _groupby.aggregate.multifunc:

Applying multiple functions at once
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On a grouped ``Series``, you can pass a list or dict of functions to
:meth:`SeriesGroupBy.agg`, outputting a DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

   grouped = df.groupby(""A"")
   grouped[""C""].agg([""sum"", ""mean"", ""std""])

On a grouped ``DataFrame``, you can pass a list of functions to
:meth:`DataFrameGroupBy.agg` to aggregate each
column, which produces an aggregated result with a hierarchical column index:

.. ipython:: python

   grouped[[""C"", ""D""]].agg([""sum"", ""mean"", ""std""])


The resulting aggregations are named after the functions themselves. For a ``Series``, if you need to rename, you can add in a chained operation like this:

.. ipython:: python

   (
       grouped[""C""]
       .agg([""sum"", ""mean"", ""std""])
       .rename(columns={""sum"": ""foo"", ""mean"": ""bar"", ""std"": ""baz""})
   )

Or, you can simply pass a list of tuples each with the name of the new column and the aggregate function:

.. ipython:: python

   (
      grouped[""C""]
      .agg([(""foo"", ""sum""), (""bar"", ""mean""), (""baz"", ""std"")])
   )

For a grouped ``DataFrame``, you can rename in a similar manner:

By chaining ``rename`` operation,

.. ipython:: python

   (
       grouped[[""C"", ""D""]].agg([""sum"", ""mean"", ""std""]).rename(
           columns={""sum"": ""foo"", ""mean"": ""bar"", ""std"": ""baz""}
       )
   )

Or, passing a list of tuples,

.. ipython:: python

   (
      grouped[[""C"", ""D""]].agg(
         [(""foo"", ""sum""), (""bar"", ""mean""), (""baz"", ""std"")]
      )
   )

.. note::

   In general, the output column names should be unique, but pandas will allow
   you apply to the same function (or two functions with the same name) to the same
   column. .. ipython:: python

      grouped[""C""].agg([""sum"", ""sum""])


   pandas also allows you to provide multiple lambdas. In this case, pandas
   will mangle the name of the (nameless) lambda functions, appending ``_<i>``
   to each subsequent lambda. .. ipython:: python

      grouped[""C""].agg([lambda x: x.max() - x.min(), lambda x: x.median() - x.mean()])


.. _groupby.aggregate.named:

Named aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support column-specific aggregation *with control over the output column names*, pandas
accepts the special syntax in :meth:`.DataFrameGroupBy.agg` and :meth:`.SeriesGroupBy.agg`, known as ""named aggregation"", where

- The keywords are the *output* column names
- The values are tuples whose first element is the column to select
  and the second element is the aggregation to apply to that column. pandas
  provides the :class:`NamedAgg` namedtuple with the fields ``['column', 'aggfunc']``
  to make it clearer what the arguments are. As usual, the aggregation can
  be a callable or a string alias. .. ipython:: python

   animals

   animals.groupby(""kind"").agg(
       min_height=pd.NamedAgg(column=""height"", aggfunc=""min""),
       max_height=pd.NamedAgg(column=""height"", aggfunc=""max""),
       average_weight=pd.NamedAgg(column=""weight"", aggfunc=""mean""),
   )


:class:`NamedAgg` is just a ``namedtuple``. Plain tuples are allowed as well. .. ipython:: python

   animals.groupby(""kind"").agg(
       min_height=(""height"", ""min""),
       max_height=(""height"", ""max""),
       average_weight=(""weight"", ""mean""),
   )


If the column names you want are not valid Python keywords, construct a dictionary
and unpack the keyword arguments

.. ipython:: python

   animals.groupby(""kind"").agg(
       **{
           ""total weight"": pd.NamedAgg(column=""weight"", aggfunc=""sum"")
       }
   )

When using named aggregation, additional keyword arguments are not passed through
to the aggregation functions; only pairs
of ``(column, aggfunc)`` should be passed as ``**kwargs``. If your aggregation functions
require additional arguments, apply them partially with :meth:`functools.partial`. Named aggregation is also valid for Series groupby aggregations. In this case there's
no column selection, so the values are just the functions.
","<s>[INST] What happens when named aggregation is applied in the context of the reconstruction process?
 [/INST] 

### [INST] What happens when named aggregation is applied in the context of the reconstruction process?
### Answer

When named aggregation is applied in the context of the reconstruction process, it allows for the specification of how to combine the results of multiple data points into a single output. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to aggregate the results in a more meaningful way or when you need to preserve the original context of each data point. 

### Example:

Suppose you have a dataset with multiple measurements of temperature at different locations, and you want to reconstruct the temperature at a specific location based on these measurements. Named aggregation can be used to combine these measurements in a way that reflects the relative importance of each location or the specific conditions.

### Code Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = {
    'Location': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'A'],
    'Temperature': [20, 25, 22, 28, 27, 24]
}

# Define named aggregation function
def named_aggregate(values, agg_func, *args):
    # Define the aggregation function
    def aggregate(*args):
        # Perform the aggregation
        result = agg_func(*args)
        # Return the aggregated value
        return result

    # Apply the aggregation function
    aggregated_values = aggregate(*values)
    # Return the aggregated results
    return aggregated_values

# Apply named aggregation to the data
aggregated_temperatures = named_aggregate(data['Temperature'], pd.Series.mean,'mean')
print(""Aggregated Temperatures:"", aggregated_temperatures)
```

### Conclusion:

Named aggregation provides a flexible way to combine the results of multiple data points while preserving the original context, making it useful in various applications where data aggregation needs to be meaningful and tailored to specific scenarios.","<s>[INST] What happens when named aggregation is applied in the context of the reconstruction process?
 [/INST] 

When named aggregation is applied in the context of the reconstruction process, the resulting data points are represented by a set of values that correspond to the aggregated results of the aggregation process. These aggregated values can be used as input for further processing, such as plotting, visualization, or modeling, as they provide a summary of the data that has been transformed through the aggregation process. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where the raw data may be complex or time-series data that requires a more interpretable form.

### Key Aspects:
1. **Representation**: The resulting values are a summary of the aggregation process, allowing for more interpretable outputs.
2. **Use**: They can be used as input for further analysis, plotting, or modeling.
3. **Interpretation**: They can help in understanding the transformations applied to the data during the aggregation process.

### Example:
Suppose we have a dataset of temperatures over time, and we apply a named aggregation function that calculates the average temperature for each time step. The resulting aggregated temperatures could be represented as a list of averages, which can then be used to visualize or analyze further.

### Summary:
In summary, when named aggregation is applied in the context of the reconstruction process, the output is a set of aggregated values that provide a summary of the data transformation, which can be further processed and interpreted.","{'overall_score': 7, 'overall_rationale': 'The answer provides a logical explanation of named aggregation and offers an example to enhance understanding.

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: When an aggregation method is provided, the result
will be broadcast across the group.
Context 2: This provides a useful syntax for constructing multiple
(potentially different) aggregations. However, ``.agg(..)`` can *also* accept a dict that allows 'renaming' of the result columns. This is a complicated and confusing syntax, as well as not consistent
between ``Series`` and ``DataFrame``. We are deprecating this 'renaming' functionality. - We are deprecating passing a dict to a grouped/rolled/resampled ``Series``. This allowed
  one to ``rename`` the resulting aggregation, but this had a completely different
  meaning than passing a dictionary to a grouped ``DataFrame``, which accepts column-to-aggregations. - We are deprecating passing a dict-of-dicts to a grouped/rolled/resampled ``DataFrame`` in a similar manner. This is an illustrative example:

.. ipython:: python

   df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 1, 1, 2, 2],
                      'B': range(5),
                      'C': range(5)})
   df

Here is a typical useful syntax for computing different aggregations for different columns. This
is a natural, and useful syntax. We aggregate from the dict-to-list by taking the specified
columns and applying the list of functions. This returns a ``MultiIndex`` for the columns (this is *not* deprecated). .. ipython:: python

   df.groupby('A').agg({'B': 'sum', 'C': 'min'})

Here's an example of the first deprecation, passing a dict to a grouped ``Series``. This
is a combination aggregation & renaming:

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [6]: df.groupby('A').B.agg({'foo': 'count'})
   FutureWarning: using a dict on a Series for aggregation
   is deprecated and will be removed in a future version

   Out[6]:
      foo
   A
   1    3
   2    2

You can accomplish the same operation, more idiomatically by:

.. ipython:: python

   df.groupby('A').B.agg(['count']).rename(columns={'count': 'foo'})


Here's an example of the second deprecation, passing a dict-of-dict to a grouped ``DataFrame``:

.. code-block:: python

   In [23]: (df.groupby('A')
       ...:    .agg({'B': {'foo': 'sum'}, 'C': {'bar': 'min'}})

   will be removed in a future version

   Out[23]:
        B   C

   2   7   3


You can accomplish nearly the same by:

.. ipython:: python

   (df.groupby('A')
      .agg({'B': 'sum', 'C': 'min'})
      .rename(columns={'B': 'foo', 'C': 'bar'})

Context 3: def reconstruct_func(func): This is the internal function to reconstruct func given if there is relabeling
or not and also normalize the keyword to get new order of columns. If named aggregation is applied, `func` will be None, and kwargs contains the
column and aggregation function information to be parsed;
If named aggregation is not applied, `func` is either string (e.g. 'min') or
Callable, or list of them (e.g. ['min', np.max]), or the dictionary of column name
and str/Callable/list of them (e.g. {'A': 'min'}, or {'A': [np.min, lambda x: x]})

If relabeling is True, will return relabeling, reconstructed func, column
names, and the reconstructed order of columns. If relabeling is False, the columns and order will be None. Parameters

Context 5: .. ipython:: python

   grouped = df.groupby(""A"")
   grouped[[""C"", ""D""]].aggregate(""sum"")

   grouped = df.groupby([""A"", ""B""])
   grouped.agg(""sum"")

The result of the aggregation will have the group names as the
new index. In the case of multiple keys, the result is a
:ref:`MultiIndex <advanced.hierarchical>` by default. As mentioned above, this can be
changed by using the ``as_index`` option:

.. ipython:: python

   grouped = df.groupby([""A"", ""B""], as_index=False)
   grouped.agg(""sum"")

   df.groupby(""A"", as_index=False)[[""C"", ""D""]].agg(""sum"")

Note that you could use the :meth:`DataFrame.reset_index` DataFrame function to achieve
the same result as the column names are stored in the resulting ``MultiIndex``, although
this will make an extra copy. .. ipython:: python

   df.groupby([""A"", ""B""]).agg(""sum"").reset_index()

.. _groupby.aggregate.udf:

Aggregation with user-defined functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can also provide their own User-Defined Functions (UDFs) for custom aggregations. .. warning::

    When aggregating with a UDF, the UDF should not mutate the
    provided ``Series``. See :ref:`gotchas.udf-mutation` for more information. .. note::

    Aggregating with a UDF is often less performant than using
    the pandas built-in methods on GroupBy. Consider breaking up a complex operation
    into a chain of operations that utilize the built-in methods. .. ipython:: python

   animals
   animals.groupby(""kind"")[[""height""]].agg(lambda x: set(x))

The resulting dtype will reflect that of the aggregating function. If the results from different groups have
different dtypes, then a common dtype will be determined in the same way as ``DataFrame`` construction. .. ipython:: python

   animals.groupby(""kind"")[[""height""]].agg(lambda x: x.astype(int).sum())

.. _groupby.aggregate.multifunc:

Applying multiple functions at once
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On a grouped ``Series``, you can pass a list or dict of functions to
:meth:`SeriesGroupBy.agg`, outputting a DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

   grouped = df.groupby(""A"")
   grouped[""C""].agg([""sum"", ""mean"", ""std""])

On a grouped ``DataFrame``, you can pass a list of functions to
:meth:`DataFrameGroupBy.agg` to aggregate each
column, which produces an aggregated result with a hierarchical column index:

.. ipython:: python

   grouped[[""C"", ""D""]].agg([""sum"", ""mean"", ""std""])


The resulting aggregations are named after the functions themselves. For a ``Series``, if you need to rename, you can add in a chained operation like this:

.. ipython:: python

   (
       grouped[""C""]
       .agg([""sum"", ""mean"", ""std""])
       .rename(columns={""sum"": ""foo"", ""mean"": ""bar"", ""std"": ""baz""})
   )

Or, you can simply pass a list of tuples each with the name of the new column and the aggregate function:

.. ipython:: python

   (
      grouped[""C""]
      .agg([(""foo"", ""sum""), (""bar"", ""mean""), (""baz"", ""std"")])
   )

For a grouped ``DataFrame``, you can rename in a similar manner:

By chaining ``rename`` operation,

.. ipython:: python

   (
       grouped[[""C"", ""D""]].agg([""sum"", ""mean"", ""std""]).rename(
           columns={""sum"": ""foo"", ""mean"": ""bar"", ""std"": ""baz""}
       )
   )

Or, passing a list of tuples,

.. ipython:: python

   (
      grouped[[""C"", ""D""]].agg(
         [(""foo"", ""sum""), (""bar"", ""mean""), (""baz"", ""std"")]
      )
   )

.. note::

   In general, the output column names should be unique, but pandas will allow
   you apply to the same function (or two functions with the same name) to the same
   column. .. ipython:: python

      grouped[""C""].agg([""sum"", ""sum""])


   pandas also allows you to provide multiple lambdas. In this case, pandas
   will mangle the name of the (nameless) lambda functions, appending ``_<i>``
   to each subsequent lambda. .. ipython:: python

      grouped[""C""].agg([lambda x: x.max() - x.min(), lambda x: x.median() - x.mean()])


.. _groupby.aggregate.named:

Named aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support column-specific aggregation *with control over the output column names*, pandas
accepts the special syntax in :meth:`.DataFrameGroupBy.agg` and :meth:`.SeriesGroupBy.agg`, known as ""named aggregation"", where

- The keywords are the *output* column names
- The values are tuples whose first element is the column to select
  and the second element is the aggregation to apply to that column. pandas
  provides the :class:`NamedAgg` namedtuple with the fields ``['column', 'aggfunc']``
  to make it clearer what the arguments are. As usual, the aggregation can
  be a callable or a string alias. .. ipython:: python

   animals

   animals.groupby(""kind"").agg(
       min_height=pd.NamedAgg(column=""height"", aggfunc=""min""),
       max_height=pd.NamedAgg(column=""height"", aggfunc=""max""),
       average_weight=pd.NamedAgg(column=""weight"", aggfunc=""mean""),
   )


:class:`NamedAgg` is just a ``namedtuple``. Plain tuples are allowed as well. .. ipython:: python

   animals.groupby(""kind"").agg(
       min_height=(""height"", ""min""),
       max_height=(""height"", ""max""),
       average_weight=(""weight"", ""mean""),
   )


If the column names you want are not valid Python keywords, construct a dictionary
and unpack the keyword arguments

.. ipython:: python

   animals.groupby(""kind"").agg(
       **{
           ""total weight"": pd.NamedAgg(column=""weight"", aggfunc=""sum"")
       }
   )

When using named aggregation, additional keyword arguments are not passed through
to the aggregation functions; only pairs
of ``(column, aggfunc)`` should be passed as ``**kwargs``. If your aggregation functions
require additional arguments, apply them partially with :meth:`functools.partial`. Named aggregation is also valid for Series groupby aggregations. In this case there's
no column selection, so the values are just the functions.
 [/INST] 

The following examples demonstrate how to use named aggregation with various aggregation methods and how to rename columns using the :meth:`DataFrame.reindex` function:

**Example 1: Named Aggregation with Multiple Functions**

*   :code:
    .. code-block:: python

     df = pd.DataFrame({
         'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
         'B': range(5),
         'C': range(5),
     })

     grouped = df.groupby('A').agg(
         lambda x: x.sum() + x.min(),
         lambda x: x.max() + x.mean(),
         lambda x: x.sum() + x.max() + x.mean()
     )

Context 3: def reconstruct_func(func): This is the internal function to reconstruct func given if there is relabeling
or not and also normalize the keyword to get new order of columns. If named aggregation is applied, `func` will be None, and kwargs contains the
column and aggregation function information to be parsed;
If named aggregation is not applied, `func` is either string (e.g. 'min') or
Callable, or list of them (e.g. ['min', np.max]), or the dictionary of column name
and str/Callable/list of them (e.g. {'A': 'min'}, or {'A': [np.min, lambda x: x]})

If relabeling is True, will return relabeling, reconstructed func, column
names, and the reconstructed order of columns. If relabeling is False, the columns and order will be None. Parameters
----------
func: agg function (e.g. 'min' or Callable) or list of agg functions
    (e.g. ['min', np.max]) or dictionary (e.g.

A
1   1   2  0.590715
2   3   4  0.704907

To control the output names with different aggregations per column,
pandas supports ""named aggregation""

>>> df.groupby(""A"").agg(
... b_min=pd.NamedAgg(column=""B"", aggfunc=""min""),
...
Context 5: .. ipython:: python

   grouped = df.groupby(""A"")
   grouped[[""C"", ""D""]].aggregate(""sum"")

   grouped = df.groupby([""A"", ""B""])
   grouped.agg(""sum"")

The result of the aggregation will have the group names as the
new index. In the case of multiple keys, the result is a
:ref:`MultiIndex <advanced.hierarchical>` by default. As mentioned above, this can be
changed by using the ``as_index`` option:

.. ipython:: python

   grouped = df.groupby([""A"", ""B""], as_index=False)
   grouped.agg(""sum"")

   df.groupby(""A"", as_index=False)[[""C"", ""D""]].agg(""sum"")

Note that you could use the :meth:`DataFrame.reset_index` DataFrame function to achieve
the same result as the column names are stored in the resulting ``MultiIndex``, although
this will make an extra copy. .. ipython:: python

   df.groupby([""A"", ""B""]).agg(""sum"").reset_index()

.. _groupby.aggregate.udf:

Aggregation with user-defined functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can also provide their own User-Defined Functions (UDFs) for custom aggregations. .. warning::

    When aggregating with a UDF, the UDF should not mutate the
    provided ``Series``. See :ref:`gotchas.udf-mutation` for more information. .. note::

    Aggregating with a UDF is often less performant than using
    the pandas built-in methods on GroupBy. Consider breaking up a complex operation
    into a chain of operations that utilize the built-in methods. .. ipython:: python

   animals
   animals.groupby(""kind"")[[""height""]].agg(lambda x: set(x))

The resulting dtype will reflect that of the aggregating function. If the results from different groups have
different dtypes, then a common dtype will be determined in the same way as ``DataFrame`` construction. .. ipython:: python

   animals.groupby(""kind"")[[""height""]].agg(lambda x: x.astype(int).sum())

.. _groupby.aggregate.multifunc:

Applying multiple functions at once
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On a grouped ``Series``, you can pass a list or dict of functions to
:meth:`SeriesGroupBy.agg`, outputting a DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

   grouped = df.groupby(""A"")
   grouped[""C""].agg([""sum"", ""mean"", ""std""])

On a grouped ``DataFrame``, you can pass a list of functions to
:meth:`DataFrameGroupBy.agg` to aggregate each
column, which produces an aggregated result with a hierarchical column index:

.. ipython:: python

   grouped[[""C"", ""D""]].agg([""sum"", ""mean"", ""std""])


The resulting aggregations are named after the functions themselves. For a ``Series``, if you need to rename, you can add in a chained operation like this:

.. ipython:: python

   (
       grouped[""C""]
       .agg([""sum"", ""mean"", ""std""])
       .rename(columns={""sum"": ""foo"", ""mean"": ""bar"", ""std"": ""baz""})
   )

Or, you can simply pass a list of tuples each with the name of the new column and the aggregate function:

.. ipython:: python

   (
      grouped[""C""]
      .agg([(""foo"", ""sum""), (""bar"", ""mean""), (""baz"", ""std"")])
   )

For a grouped ``DataFrame``, you can rename in a similar manner:

By chaining ``rename`` operation,

.. ipython:: python

   (
       grouped[[""C"", ""D""]].agg([""sum"", ""mean"", ""std""]).rename(
           columns={""sum"": ""foo"", ""mean"": ""bar"", ""std"": ""baz""}
       )
   )

Or, passing a list of tuples,

.. ipython:: python

   (
      grouped[[""C"", ""D""]].agg(
         [(""foo"", ""sum""), (""bar"", ""mean""), (""baz"", ""std"")]
      )
   )

.. note::

   In general, the output column names should be unique, but pandas will allow
   you apply to the same function (or two functions with the same name) to the same
   column. .. ipython:: python

      grouped[""C""].agg([""sum"", ""sum""])


   pandas also allows you to provide multiple lambdas. In this case, pandas
   will mangle the name of the (nameless) lambda functions, appending ``_<i>``
   to each subsequent lambda. .. ipython:: python

      grouped[""C""].agg([lambda x: x.max() - x.min(), lambda x: x.median() - x.mean()])


.. _groupby.aggregate.named:

Named aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support column-specific aggregation *with control over the output column names*, pandas
accepts the special syntax in :meth:`.DataFrameGroupBy.agg` and :meth:`.SeriesGroupBy.agg`, known as ""named aggregation"", where

- The keywords are the *output* column names
- The values are tuples whose first element is the column to select
  and the second element is the aggregation to apply to that column. pandas
  provides the :class:`NamedAgg` namedtuple with the fields ``['column', 'aggfunc']``
  to make it clearer what the arguments are. As usual, the aggregation can
  be a callable or a string alias. .. ipython:: python

   animals

   animals.groupby(""kind"").agg(
       min_height=pd.NamedAgg(column=""height"", aggfunc=""min""),
       max_height=pd.NamedAgg(column=""height"", aggfunc=""max""),
       average_weight=pd.NamedAgg(column=""weight"", aggfunc=""mean""),
   )


:class:`NamedAgg` is just a ``namedtuple``. Plain tuples are allowed as well. .. ipython:: python

   animals.groupby(""kind"").agg(
       min_height=(""height"", ""min""),
       max_height=(""height"", ""max""),
       average_weight=(""weight"", ""mean""),
   )


If the column names you want are not valid Python keywords, construct a dictionary
and unpack the keyword arguments

.. ipython:: python

   animals.groupby(""kind"").agg(
       **{
           ""total weight"": pd.NamedAgg(column=""weight"", aggfunc=""sum"")
       }
   )

When using named aggregation, additional keyword arguments are not passed through
to the aggregation functions; only pairs
of ``(column, aggfunc)`` should be passed as ``**kwargs``. If your aggregation functions
require additional arguments, apply them partially with :meth:`functools.partial`. Named aggregation is also valid for Series groupby aggregations. In this case there's
no column selection, so the values are just the functions.
