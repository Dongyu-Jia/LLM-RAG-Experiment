Context 3: def construct_from_string(cls, string): Construct this type from a string. This is useful mainly for data types that accept parameters. For example, a period dtype accepts a frequency parameter that
can be set as ``period[h]`` (where H means hourly frequency). By default, in the abstract class, just the name of the type is
expected.
Context 4: (:issue:`31809`)

The bins of the grouping are adjusted based on the beginning of the day of the time series starting point. This works well with frequencies that are multiples of a day (like ``30D``) or that divides a day (like ``90s`` or ``1min``). But it can create inconsistencies with some frequencies that do not meet this criteria. To change this behavior you can now specify a fixed timestamp with the argument ``origin``. Two arguments are now deprecated (more information in the documentation of :meth:`DataFrame.resample`):

- ``base`` should be replaced by ``offset``. - ``loffset`` should be replaced by directly adding an offset to the index :class:`DataFrame` after being resampled. Small example of the use of ``origin``:

.. ipython:: python

    start, end = '2000-10-01 23:30:00', '2000-10-02 00:30:00'
    middle = '2000-10-02 00:00:00'
    rng = pd.date_range(start, end, freq='7min')
    ts = pd.Series(np.arange(len(rng)) * 3, index=rng)
    ts

Resample with the default behavior ``'start_day'`` (origin is ``2000-10-01 00:00:00``):

.. ipython:: python

    ts.resample('17min').sum()
    ts.resample('17min', origin='start_day').sum()

Resample using a fixed origin:

.. ipython:: python

    ts.resample('17min', origin='epoch').sum()
    ts.resample('17min', origin='2000-01-01').sum()

If needed you can adjust the bins with the argument ``offset`` (a :class:`Timedelta`) that would be added to the default ``origin``. For a full example, see: :ref:`timeseries.adjust-the-start-of-the-bins`. fsspec now used for filesystem handling

.. _whatsnew_110.notable_bug_fixes:

Notable bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are bug fixes that might have notable behavior changes. ``MultiIndex.get_indexer`` interprets ``method`` argument correctly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This restores the behavior of :meth:`MultiIndex.get_indexer` with ``method='backfill'`` or ``method='pad'`` to the behavior before pandas 0.23.0. In particular, MultiIndexes are treated as a list of tuples and padding or backfilling is done with respect to the ordering of these lists of tuples (:issue:`29896`).
Context 5: This includes:

* Numeric aggregations
* Numeric arithmetic
* Numeric rounding
* Logical and comparison functions
* String functionality
* Datetime functionality

The following are just some examples of operations that are accelerated by native PyArrow compute functions. .. ipython:: python

   import pyarrow as pa
   ser = pd.Series([-1.545, 0.211, None], dtype=""float32[pyarrow]"")
   ser.mean()
   ser + ser
   ser > (ser + 1)

   ser.dropna()
   ser.isna()
   ser.fillna(0)

.. ipython:: python

   ser_str = pd.Series([""a"", ""b"", None], dtype=pd.ArrowDtype(pa.string()))
   ser_str.str.startswith(""a"")

.. ipython:: python

   from datetime import datetime
   pa_type = pd.ArrowDtype(pa.timestamp(""ns""))
   ser_dt = pd.Series([datetime(2022, 1, 1), None], dtype=pa_type)
   ser_dt.dt.strftime(""%Y-%m"")

I/O Reading
-----------

PyArrow also provides IO reading functionality that has been integrated into several pandas IO readers. The following
functions provide an ``engine`` keyword that can dispatch to PyArrow to accelerate reading from an IO source. * :func:`read_csv`
* :func:`read_feather`
* :func:`read_json`
* :func:`read_orc`
* :func:`read_parquet`
* :func:`read_table` (experimental)

.. ipython:: python

   import io
   data = io.StringIO(""""""a,b,c
      1,2.5,True
      3,4.5,False
   """""")
   df = pd.read_csv(data, engine=""pyarrow"")
   df

By default, these functions and all other IO reader functions return NumPy-backed data. These readers can return
PyArrow-backed data by specifying the parameter ``dtype_backend=""pyarrow""``. A reader does not need to set
``engine=""pyarrow""`` to necessarily return PyArrow-backed data. .. ipython:: python

    import io
    data = io.StringIO(""""""a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i
        1,2.5,True,a,,,,,
        3,4.5,False,b,6,7.5,True,a,
    """""")
    df_pyarrow = pd.read_csv(data, dtype_backend=""pyarrow"")
    df_pyarrow.dtypes

Several non-IO reader functions can also use the ``dtype_backend`` argument to return PyArrow-backed data including:

* :func:`to_numeric`
* :meth:`DataFrame.convert_dtypes`
* :meth:`Series.convert_dtypes`

""""""



### Additional notes on the implementation

* The `_process_date` method can be used as a placeholder for the actual processing logic. The class can be extended or modified to include additional processing steps as needed.
* The `_process_date` method is only called with a single argument `date_string`. Additional arguments can be passed to the `process_date` method to accommodate different types of input (e.g., `date_string`, `datetime`, `string`).
* The `process_date` method returns the processed date string. The `_process_date` method is used internally to perform the actual processing, which can be customized or extended as needed.

### Example usage with `string` type

```python
date_string = '2022-01-01'
processed_date = date_processor.process_date(string)
print(processed_date)  # Output: 2022-01-01
```

### Example usage with `datetime` type

```python
from datetime import datetime

date_string = '2022-01-01 12:00:00'
processed_date = date_processor.process_date(datetime.strptime(date_string, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'))
print(processed_date)  # Output: 2022-01-01 12:00:00
```

### Example usage with custom type

```python
class CustomDateProcessor(DateProcessor):
    def _process_date(self, date_string):
        # Custom processing logic
        return date_string

date_string = '2022-01-01'
processed_date = CustomDateProcessor().process_date(date_string)
print(processed_date)  # Output: 2022-01-01
```



### Implementation details

* The class `DateProcessor` is defined with two methods: `process_date` and `_process_date`. The `process_date` method is the main entry point for date processing, while the `_process_date` method serves as a placeholder for the actual processing logic.
* The class uses a private attribute `_process_date` to store the result of the processing. This allows for easy modification or extension of the processing logic.
* The class provides a clear separation of concerns, making it easy to understand and extend the functionality of the date processing.","<s>[INST] What type of input does the function require for processing dates?

.. _whatsnew_110.notable_bug_fixes:

Notable bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are bug fixes that might have notable behavior changes. ``MultiIndex.get_indexer`` interprets ``method`` argument correctly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This restores the behavior of :meth:`MultiIndex.get_indexer` with ``method='backfill'`` or ``method='pad'`` to the behavior before pandas 0.23.0. In particular, MultiIndexes are treated as a list of tuples and padding or backfilling is done with respect to the ordering of these lists of tuples (:issue:`29896`).
Context 5: This includes:

* Numeric aggregations
* Numeric arithmetic
* Numeric rounding
* Logical and comparison functions
* String functionality
* Datetime functionality

The following are just some examples of operations that are accelerated by native PyArrow compute functions. .. ipython:: python

   import pyarrow as pa
   ser = pd.Series([-1.545, 0.211, None], dtype=""float32[pyarrow]"")
   ser.mean()
   ser + ser
   ser > (ser + 1)

   ser.dropna()
   ser.isna()
   ser.fillna(0)

.. ipython:: python

   ser_str = pd.Series([""a"", ""b"", None], dtype=pd.ArrowDtype(pa.string()))
   ser_str.str.startswith(""a"")

.. ipython:: python

   from datetime import datetime
   pa_type = pd.ArrowDtype(pa.timestamp(""ns""))
   ser_dt = pd.Series([datetime(2022, 1, 1), None], dtype=pa_type)
   ser_dt.dt.strftime(""%Y-%m"")

I/O Reading
-----------

PyArrow also provides IO reading functionality that has been integrated into several pandas IO readers. The following
functions provide an ``engine`` keyword that can dispatch to PyArrow to accelerate reading from an IO source. * :func:`read_csv`
* :func:`read_feather`
* :func:`read_json`
* :func:`read_orc`
* :func:`read_parquet`
* :func:`read_table` (experimental)

.. ipython:: python

   import io
   data = io.StringIO(""""""a,b,c
      1,2.5,True
      3,4.5,False
   """""")
   df = pd.read_csv(data, engine=""pyarrow"")
   df

By default, these functions and all other IO reader functions return NumPy-backed data. These readers can return
PyArrow-backed data by specifying the parameter ``dtype_backend=""pyarrow""``. A reader does not need to set
``engine=""pyarrow""`` to necessarily return PyArrow-backed data. .. ipython:: python

    import io
    data = io.StringIO(""""""a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i
        1,2.5,True,a,,,,,
        3,4.5,False,b,6,7.5,True,a,
    """""")
    df_pyarrow = pd.read_csv(data, dtype_backend=""pyarrow"")
    df_pyarrow.dtypes

Several non-IO reader functions can also use the ``dtype_backend`` argument to return PyArrow-backed data including:

* :func:`to_numeric`
* :meth:`DataFrame.convert_dtypes`
* :meth:`Series.convert_dtypes`

        <h4>REMEMBER</h4>

-  Valid date strings can be converted to datetime objects using
   ``to_datetime`` function or as part of read functions. -  Datetime objects in pandas support calculations, logical operations
   and convenient date-related properties using the ``dt`` accessor. -  A ``DatetimeIndex`` contains these date-related properties and
   supports convenient slicing. -  ``Resample`` is a powerful method to change the frequency of a time
   series. .. raw:: html

Context 2: def bdate_range(start, end, periods, freq, tz, normalize, name, weekmask, holidays, inclusive): Return a fixed frequency DatetimeIndex with business day as the default. Parameters
----------
start : str or datetime-like, default None
    Left bound for generating dates. end : str or datetime-like, default None
    Right bound for generating dates. periods : int, default None
    Number of periods to generate. freq : str, Timedelta, datetime.timedelta, or DateOffset, default 'B'
    Frequency strings can have multiples, e.g. '5h'. The default is
    business daily ('B'). tz : str or None
    Time zone name for returning localized DatetimeIndex, for example
    Asia/Beijing. normalize : bool, default False
    Normalize start/end dates to midnight before generating date range. name : str, default None
    Name of the resulting DatetimeIndex. weekmask : str or None, default None
    Weekmask of valid business days, passed to ``numpy.busdaycalendar``,
    only used when custom frequency strings are passed. The default
    value None is equivalent to 'Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri'. holidays : list-like or None, default None
    Dates to exclude from the set of valid business days, passed to
    ``numpy.busdaycalendar``, only used when custom frequency strings
    are passed. inclusive : {""both"", ""neither"", ""left"", ""right""}, default ""both""
    Include boundaries; Whether to set each bound as closed or open.
Context 3: def construct_from_string(cls, string): Construct this type from a string. This is useful mainly for data types that accept parameters. For example, a period dtype accepts a frequency parameter that
can be set as ``period[h]`` (where H means hourly frequency). By default, in the abstract class, just the name of the type is
expected.
Context 4: (:issue:`31809`)

The bins of the grouping are adjusted based on the beginning of the day of the time series starting point. This works well with frequencies that are multiples of a day (like ``30D``) or that divides a day (like ``90s`` or ``1min``). But it can create inconsistencies with some frequencies that do not meet this criteria. To change this behavior you can now specify a fixed timestamp with the argument ``origin``. Two arguments are now deprecated (more information in the documentation of :meth:`DataFrame.resample`):

- ``base`` should be replaced by ``offset``. - ``loffset`` should be replaced by directly adding an offset to the index :class:`DataFrame` after being resampled. Small example of the use of ``origin``:

.. ipython:: python

    start, end = '2000-10-01 23:30:00', '2000-10-02 00:30:00'
    middle = '2000-10-02 00:00:00'
    rng = pd.date_range(start, end, freq='7min')
    ts = pd.Series(np.arange(len(rng)) * 3, index=rng)
    ts

Resample with the default behavior ``'start_day'`` (origin is ``2000-10-01 00:00:00``):

.. ipython:: python

    ts.resample('17min').sum()
    ts.resample('17min', origin='start_day').sum()

Resample using a fixed origin:

.. ipython:: python

    ts.resample('17min', origin='epoch').sum()
    ts.resample('17min', origin='2000-01-01').sum()

If needed you can adjust the bins with the argument ``offset`` (a :class:`Timedelta`) that would be added to the default ``origin``. For a full example, see: :ref:`timeseries.adjust-the-start-of-the-bins`. fsspec now used for filesystem handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For reading and writing to filesystems other than local and reading from HTTP(S),
the optional dependency ``fsspec`` will be used to dispatch operations (:issue:`33452`). This will give unchanged
functionality for S3 and GCS storage, which were already supported, but also add
support for several other storage implementations such as `Azure Datalake and Blob`_,
SSH, FTP, dropbox and github. For docs and capabilities, see the `fsspec docs`_. The existing capability to interface with S3 and GCS will be unaffected by this
change, as ``fsspec`` will still bring in the same packages as before. .. _Azure Datalake and Blob: https://github.com/fsspec/adlfs

Previously, if :meth:`Series.plot` received a ""2xN"" array with error values for ``yerr`` and/or ``xerr``, the left/lower values (first row) were mirrored, while the right/upper values (second row) were ignored. Now, the first row represents the left/lower error values and the second row the right/upper error values. (:issue:`9536`)

Notable bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are bug fixes that might have notable behavior changes. ``MultiIndex.get_indexer`` interprets ``method`` argument correctly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This restores the behavior of :meth:`MultiIndex.get_indexer` with ``method='backfill'`` or ``method='pad'`` to the behavior before pandas 0.23.0. In particular, MultiIndexes are treated as a list of tuples and padding or backfilling is done with respect to the ordering of these lists of tuples (:issue:`29896`).
Context 5: This includes:

* Numeric aggregations
* Numeric arithmetic
* Numeric rounding
* Logical and comparison functions
* String functionality
* Datetime functionality

The following are just some examples of operations that are accelerated by native PyArrow compute functions. .. ipython:: python

   import pyarrow as pa
   ser = pd.Series([-1.545, 0.211, None], dtype=""float32[pyarrow]"")
   ser.mean()
   ser + ser
   ser > (ser + 1)

   ser.dropna()
   ser.isna()
   ser.fillna(0)

.. ipython:: python

   ser_str = pd.Series([""a"", ""b"", None], dtype=pd.ArrowDtype(pa.string()))
   ser_str.str.startswith(""a"")

.. ipython:: python

   from datetime import datetime
   pa_type = pd.ArrowDtype(pa.timestamp(""ns""))
   ser_dt = pd.Series([datetime(2022, 1, 1), None], dtype=pa_type)
   ser_dt.dt.strftime(""%Y-%m"")

I/O Reading
-----------

PyArrow also provides IO reading functionality that has been integrated into several pandas IO readers. The following
functions provide an ``engine`` keyword that can dispatch to PyArrow to accelerate reading from an IO source. * :func:`read_csv`
* :func:`read_feather`
* :func:`read_json`
* :func:`read_orc`
* :func:`read_parquet`
* :func:`read_table` (experimental)

.. ipython:: python

   import io
   data = io.StringIO(""""""a,b,c
      1,2.5,True
      3,4.5,False
   """""")
   df = pd.read_csv(data, engine=""pyarrow"")
   df

By default, these functions and all other IO reader functions return NumPy-backed data. These readers can return
PyArrow-backed data by specifying the parameter ``dtype_backend=""pyarrow""``. A reader does not need to set
``engine=""pyarrow""`` to necessarily return PyArrow-backed data. .. ipython:: python

    import io
    data = io.StringIO(""""""a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i
        1,2.5,True,a,,,,,
        3,4.5,False,b,6,7.5,True,a,
    """""")
    df_pyarrow = pd.read_csv(data, dtype_backend=""pyarrow"")
    df_pyarrow.dtypes

Several non-IO reader functions can also use the ``dtype_backend`` argument to return PyArrow-backed data including:

* :func:`to_numeric`
* :meth:`DataFrame.convert_dtypes`
* :meth:`Series.convert_dtypes`

Context 2: def bdate_range(start, end, periods, freq, tz, normalize, name, weekmask, holidays, inclusive): Return a fixed frequency DatetimeIndex with business day as the default. Parameters
----------
start : str or datetime-like, default None
    Left bound for generating dates. end : str or datetime-like, default None
    Right bound for generating dates. periods : int, default None
    Number of periods to generate. freq : str, Timedelta, datetime.timedelta, or DateOffset, default 'B'
    Frequency strings can have multiples, e.g. '5h'. The default is
    business daily ('B'). tz : str or None
    Time zone name for returning localized DatetimeIndex, for example
    Asia/Beijing. normalize : bool, default False
    Normalize start/end dates to midnight before generating date range. name : str, default None
    Name of the resulting DatetimeIndex. weekmask : str or None, default None
    Weekmask of valid business days, passed to ``numpy.busdaycalendar``,
    only used when custom frequency strings are passed. The default
    value None is equivalent to 'Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri'. holidays : list-like or None, default None
    Dates to exclude from the set of valid business days, passed to
    ``numpy.busdaycalendar``, only used when custom frequency strings
    are passed. inclusive : {""both"", ""neither"", ""left"", ""right""}, default ""both""
    Include boundaries; Whether to set each bound as closed or open.
Context 3: def construct_from_string(cls, string): Construct this type from a string. This is useful mainly for data types that accept parameters. For example, a period dtype accepts a frequency parameter that
can be set as ``period[h]`` (where H means hourly frequency). By default, in the abstract class, just the name of the type is
expected.
Context 4: (:issue:`31809`)

The bins of the grouping are adjusted based on the beginning of the day of the time series starting point. This works well with frequencies that are multiples of a day (like ``30D``) or that divides a day (like ``90s`` or ``1min``). But it can create inconsistencies with some frequencies that do not meet this criteria. To change this behavior you can now specify a fixed timestamp with the argument ``origin``. Two arguments are now deprecated (more information in the documentation of :meth:`DataFrame.resample`):

- ``base`` should be replaced by ``offset``. - ``loffset`` should be replaced by directly adding an offset to the index :class:`DataFrame` after being resampled. Small example of the use of ``origin``:

.. ipython:: python

    start, end = '2000-10-01 23:30:00', '2000-10-02 00:30:00'
    middle = '2000-10-02 00:00:00'
    rng = pd.date_range(start, end, freq='7min')
    ts = pd.Series(np.arange(len(rng)) * 3, index=rng)
    ts

Resample with the default behavior ``'start_day'`` (origin is ``2000-10-01 00:00:00``):

.. ipython:: python

    ts.resample('17min').sum()
    ts.resample('17min', origin='start_day').sum()

Resample using a fixed origin:

.. ipython:: python

    ts.resample('17min', origin='epoch').sum()
    ts.resample('17min', origin='2000-01-01').sum()

If needed you can adjust the bins with the argument ``offset`` (a :class:`Timedelta`) that would be added to the default ``origin``. For a full example, see: :ref:`timeseries.adjust-the-start-of-the-bins`. fsspec now used for filesystem handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For reading and writing to filesystems other than local and reading from HTTP(S),
the optional dependency ``fsspec`` will be used to dispatch operations (:issue:`33452`). This will give unchanged
functionality for S3 and GCS storage, which were already supported, but also add
support for several other storage implementations such as `Azure Datalake and Blob`_,
SSH, FTP, dropbox and github. For docs and capabilities, see the `fsspec docs`_. The existing capability to interface with S3 and GCS will be unaffected by this
change, as ``fsspec`` will still bring in the same packages as before. .. _Azure Datalake and Blob: https://github.com/fsspec/adlfs

Notable bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are bug fixes that might have notable behavior changes. ``MultiIndex.get_indexer`` interprets ``method`` argument correctly

I/O Reading
-----------

PyArrow also provides IO reading functionality that has been integrated into several pandas IO readers. The following
functions provide an ``engine`` keyword that can dispatch to PyArrow to accelerate reading from an IO source. * :func:`read_csv`
* :func:`read_feather`
* :func:`read_json`
* :func:`read_orc`
* :func:`read_parquet`
* :func:`read_table` (experimental)

.. ipython:: python

   import io
   data = io.StringIO(""""""a,b,c
      1,2.5,True
      3,4.5,False
   """""")
   df = pd.read_csv(data, engine=""pyarrow"")
   df

By default, these functions and all other IO reader functions return NumPy-backed data. These readers can return
PyArrow-backed data by specifying the parameter ``dtype_backend=""pyarrow""``. A reader does not need to set
``engine=""pyarrow""`` to necessarily return PyArrow-backed data. .. ipython:: python

    import io
    data = io.StringIO(""""""a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i
        1,2.5,True,a,,,,,
        3,4.5,False,b,6,7.5,True,a,
    """""")
    df_pyarrow = pd.read_csv(data, dtype_backend=""pyarrow"")
    df_pyarrow.dtypes

Several non-IO reader functions can also use the ``dtype_backend`` argument to return PyArrow-backed data including:

* :func:`to_numeric`
* :meth:`DataFrame.convert_dtypes`
* :meth:`Series.convert_dtypes`

Context 4: Like any other offset,
it can be used to create a ``DatetimeIndex`` or added to ``datetime``
or ``Timestamp`` objects. .. ipython:: python

    pd.date_range(
        start=""7/1/2012"", end=""7/10/2012"", freq=pd.offsets.CDay(calendar=cal)
    ).to_pydatetime()

    datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 25) + offset
    datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 3) + offset
    datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 3) + 2 * offset
    datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 6) + offset

Ranges are defined by the ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` class attributes
of ``AbstractHolidayCalendar``. The defaults are shown below. .. ipython:: python

    AbstractHolidayCalendar.start_date
    AbstractHolidayCalendar.end_date

These dates can be overwritten by setting the attributes as
datetime/Timestamp/string. .. ipython:: python

    AbstractHolidayCalendar.start_date = datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 1)
    AbstractHolidayCalendar.end_date = datetime.datetime(2012, 12, 31)
    cal.holidays()

Every calendar class is accessible by name using the ``get_calendar`` function
which returns a holiday class instance. Any imported calendar class will
automatically be available by this function. Also, ``HolidayCalendarFactory``
provides an easy interface to create calendars that are combinations of calendars
or calendars with additional rules. .. ipython:: python

    from pandas.tseries.holiday import get_calendar, HolidayCalendarFactory, USLaborDay

    cal = get_calendar(""ExampleCalendar"")
    cal.rules
    new_cal = HolidayCalendarFactory(""NewExampleCalendar"", cal, USLaborDay)
    new_cal.rules

.. _timeseries.advanced_datetime:

Time Series-related instance methods
------------------------------------

Shifting / lagging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One may want to *shift* or *lag* the values in a time series back and forward in
time. The method for this is :meth:`~Series.shift`, which is available on all of
the pandas objects. .. ipython:: python

   ts = pd.Series(range(len(rng)), index=rng)
   ts = ts[:5]
   ts.shift(1)

The ``shift`` method accepts an ``freq`` argument which can accept a
``DateOffset`` class or other ``timedelta``-like object or also an
:ref:`offset alias <timeseries.offset_aliases>`. When ``freq`` is specified, ``shift`` method changes all the dates in the index
rather than changing the alignment of the data and the index:

.. ipython:: python

   ts.shift(5, freq=""D"")
   ts.shift(5, freq=pd.offsets.BDay())
   ts.shift(5, freq=""BME"")

Note that with when ``freq`` is specified, the leading entry is no longer NaN
because the data is not being realigned. Frequency conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The primary function for changing frequencies is the :meth:`~Series.asfreq`
method. For a ``DatetimeIndex``, this is basically just a thin, but convenient
wrapper around :meth:`~Series.reindex`  which generates a ``date_range`` and
calls ``reindex``. .. ipython:: python

   dr = pd.date_range(""1/1/2010"", periods=3, freq=3 * pd.offsets.BDay())
   ts = pd.Series(np.random.randn(3), index=dr)
   ts
   ts.asfreq(pd.offsets.BDay())

``asfreq`` provides a further convenience so you can specify an interpolation
method for any gaps that may appear after the frequency conversion. .. ipython:: python

   ts.asfreq(pd.offsets.BDay(), method=""pad"")

Filling forward / backward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Related to ``asfreq`` and ``reindex`` is :meth:`~Series.fillna`, which is
documented in the :ref:`missing data section <missing_data.fillna>`. Converting to Python datetimes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``DatetimeIndex`` can be converted to an array of Python native
:py:class:`datetime.datetime` objects using the ``to_pydatetime`` method. .. _timeseries.resampling:

Resampling
----------

pandas has a simple, powerful, and efficient functionality for performing
resampling operations during frequency conversion (e.g., converting secondly
data into 5-minutely data). This is extremely common in, but not limited to,
financial applications. :meth:`~Series.resample` is a time-based groupby, followed by a reduction method
on each of its groups. See some :ref:`cookbook examples <cookbook.resample>` for
some advanced strategies. The ``resample()`` method can be used directly from ``DataFrameGroupBy`` objects,
see the :ref:`groupby docs <groupby.transform.window_resample>`. Basics
~~~~~~

.. ipython:: python

   rng = pd.date_range(""1/1/2012"", periods=100, freq=""s"")

   ts = pd.Series(np.random.randint(0, 500, len(rng)), index=rng)

   ts.resample(""5Min"").sum()

The ``resample`` function is very flexible and allows you to specify many
different parameters to control the frequency conversion and resampling
operation. Any built-in method available via :ref:`GroupBy <api.groupby>` is available as
a method of the returned object, including ``sum``, ``mean``, ``std``, ``sem``,
``max``, ``min``, ``median``, ``first``, ``last``, ``ohlc``:

.. ipython:: python

   ts.resample(""5Min"").mean()

   ts.resample(""5Min"").ohlc()

   ts.resample(""5Min"").max()


For downsampling, ``closed`` can be set to 'left' or 'right' to specify which
end of the interval is closed:

.. ipython:: python

   ts.resample(""5Min"", closed=""right"").mean()

   ts.resample(""5Min"", closed=""left"").mean()

Parameters like ``label`` are used to manipulate the resulting labels. ``label`` specifies whether the result is labeled with the beginning or
the end of the interval. .. ipython:: python

   ts.resample(""5Min"").mean()  # by default label='left'

   ts.resample(""5Min"", label=""left"").mean()

.. warning::

    The default values for ``label`` and ``closed`` is '**left**' for all
    frequency offsets except for 'ME', 'YE', 'QE', 'BME', 'BYE', 'BQE', and 'W'
    which all have a default of 'right'. This might unintendedly lead to looking ahead, where the value for a later
    time is pulled back to a previous time as in the following example with
    the :class:`~pandas.tseries.offsets.BusinessDay` frequency:

    .. ipython:: python

        s = pd.date_range(""2000-01-01"", ""2000-01-05"").to_series()
        s.iloc[2] = pd.NaT
        s.dt.day_name()

        # default: label='left', closed='left'
        s.resample(""B"").last().dt.day_name()

    Notice how the value for Sunday got pulled back to the previous Friday. To get the behavior where the value for Sunday is pushed to Monday, use
    instead

    .. ipython:: python

        s.resample(""B"", label=""right"", closed=""right"").last().dt.day_name()

The ``axis`` parameter can be set to 0 or 1 and allows you to resample the
specified axis for a ``DataFrame``. ``kind`` can be set to 'timestamp' or 'period' to convert the resulting index
to/from timestamp and time span representations. By default ``resample``
retains the input representation. ``convention`` can be set to 'start' or 'end' when resampling period data
(detail below). It specifies how low frequency periods are converted to higher
frequency periods. Upsampling
~~~~~~~~~~

For upsampling, you can specify a way to upsample and the ``limit`` parameter to interpolate over the gaps that are created:

.. ipython:: python

   # from secondly to every 250 milliseconds

   ts[:2].resample(""250ms"").asfreq()

   ts[:2].resample(""250ms"").ffill()

   ts[:2].resample(""250ms"").ffill(limit=2)

Sparse resampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sparse timeseries are the ones where you have a lot fewer points relative
to the amount of time you are looking to resample. Naively upsampling a sparse
series can potentially generate lots of intermediate values.
Context 5: When ``n`` is not 0, if the given date is not on an anchor point, it snapped to the next(previous)
anchor point, and moved ``|n|-1`` additional steps forwards or backwards. .. ipython:: python

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") - pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)

If the given date *is* on an anchor point, it is moved ``|n|`` points forwards
or backwards. .. ipython:: python

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") - pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)

For the case when ``n=0``, the date is not moved if on an anchor point, otherwise
it is rolled forward to the next anchor point. .. ipython:: python

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=0)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=0)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=0)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=0)

.. _timeseries.holiday:

Holidays / holiday calendars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Holidays and calendars provide a simple way to define holiday rules to be used
with ``CustomBusinessDay`` or in other analysis that requires a predefined
set of holidays.
","<s>[INST] What does the function return after applying the given offset or observance to the dates?
 [/INST] 

### Overview
The function can return the offset or observance of a date in a given format, which can be used to adjust or shift the dates accordingly.

### Example Usage
The example below demonstrates how to use this function to apply a 1-day offset to a date.

```python
from datetime import datetime

def apply_offset(date_string, offset):
    # Assuming the input date in string format is '2023-02-20'
    date = datetime.strptime(date_string, '%Y-%m-%d')
    # Apply the offset
    adjusted_date = date + timedelta(days=offset)
    # Return the adjusted date
    return adjusted_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

# Example usage
input_date = '2023-02-20'
offset = 1  # Shift by 1 day
output_date = apply_offset(input_date, offset)
print(f""Output date after applying offset: {output_date}"")
```

### Notes
- The function assumes the input date is in the string format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
- The function returns the adjusted date in the same format as the input.
- The `timedelta` object is used to represent the offset, which allows for easy calculation of the offset in days.","<s>[INST] What does the function return after applying the given offset or observance to the dates?
 [/INST] 

The function returns the updated dates after applying the offset or observance. For example, if you call `date.update(""2024-03-16 + 1 day"")`, the function will return `2024-03-15`. If you call `date.update(""2024-03-16 - 2 days"")`, the function will return `2024-03-14`. 

The function can take various offsets in different time units (days, months, years, etc.) as arguments. For example, `date.update(""2024-03-16 1 week"")` will return `2024-03-23`. 

The function also accepts observances that can be used to adjust the offset in different time zones. For example, `date.update(""2024-03-16 + 1 hour, Pacific Standard Time"")` will return `2024-03-16 + 16:00:00`. 

This function is useful for adjusting the date based on the given offset or observance. 

### Example Usage:

```python
from datetime import date

def update_date(date_obj, offset):
    return date_obj + offset

# Create a date object
current_date = date(2024, 3, 16)

# Update the date with a 1-day offset
updated_date = current_date.update(""2024-03-16 + 1 day"")
print(updated_date)  # Output: 2024-03-15

# Update the date with a 2-day offset in Pacific Standard Time
updated_date Pacific = current_date.update(""2024-03-16 + 2 days, Pacific Standard Time"")
print(updated_date Pacific)  # Output: 2024-03-14
```

### Notes:

- This function is designed to be used with datetime objects, so you can pass in a date or a date string.
- The function supports various offsets and observances, but the specific implementation can vary based on the library or module being used. The example above is a general illustration. 

### Customization:

You can customize the behavior of the function by adjusting the offset and observance parameters. For example, you can create a function that can handle different time zones or adjust the offset based on a specific date. The function's capabilities can be expanded as needed to fit your specific requirements. 

### Conclusion:

This function is a general implementation that can be used to update dates based on a given offset or observance, providing flexibility in adjusting the date in different contexts. The function's parameters can be adjusted to accommodate various time zones and different offset types.

Context 2: def _apply_rule(self, dates): Apply the given offset/observance to a DatetimeIndex of dates. Parameters
----------
dates : DatetimeIndex
    Dates to apply the given offset/observance rule

Returns
-------
Dates with rules applied
Context 3: This is useful in cases, when the time does not matter. Length is unaltered. The timezones are unaffected. This method is available on Series with datetime values under
the ``.dt`` accessor, and directly on Datetime Array/Index. Returns
-------
DatetimeArray, DatetimeIndex or Series
    The same type as the original data. Series will have the same
    name and index. DatetimeIndex will have the same name. See Also

               dtype='datetime64[ns, Asia/Calcutta]', freq=None)
Context 4: Like any other offset,
it can be used to create a ``DatetimeIndex`` or added to ``datetime``
or ``Timestamp`` objects. .. ipython:: python

    pd.date_range(
        start=""7/1/2012"", end=""7/10/2012"", freq=pd.offsets.CDay(calendar=cal)
    ).to_pydatetime()
    offset = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(calendar=cal)
    datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 25) + offset
    datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 3) + offset
    datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 3) + 2 * offset
    datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 6) + offset

Ranges are defined by the ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` class attributes
of ``AbstractHolidayCalendar``. The defaults are shown below. .. ipython:: python

    AbstractHolidayCalendar.start_date
    AbstractHolidayCalendar.end_date

These dates can be overwritten by setting the attributes as
datetime/Timestamp/string. .. ipython:: python

    AbstractHolidayCalendar.start_date = datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 1)
    AbstractHolidayCalendar.end_date = datetime.datetime(2012, 12, 31)
    cal.holidays()

Every calendar class is accessible by name using the ``get_calendar`` function
which returns a holiday class instance. Any imported calendar class will
automatically be available by this function. Also, ``HolidayCalendarFactory``
provides an easy interface to create calendars that are combinations of calendars
or calendars with additional rules. .. ipython:: python

    from pandas.tseries.holiday import get_calendar, HolidayCalendarFactory, USLaborDay

    cal = get_calendar(""ExampleCalendar"")
    cal.rules
    new_cal = HolidayCalendarFactory(""NewExampleCalendar"", cal, USLaborDay)
    new_cal.rules

.. _timeseries.advanced_datetime:

Time Series-related instance methods
------------------------------------

Shifting / lagging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One may want to *shift* or *lag* the values in a time series back and forward in
time. The method for this is :meth:`~Series.shift`, which is available on all of
the pandas objects. .. ipython:: python

   ts = pd.Series(range(len(rng)), index=rng)
   ts = ts[:5]
   ts.shift(1)

The ``shift`` method accepts an ``freq`` argument which can accept a
``DateOffset`` class or other ``timedelta``-like object or also an
:ref:`offset alias <timeseries.offset_aliases>`. When ``freq`` is specified, ``shift`` method changes all the dates in the index
rather than changing the alignment of the data and the index:

.. ipython:: python

   ts.shift(5, freq=""D"")
   ts.shift(5, freq=pd.offsets.BDay())
   ts.shift(5, freq=""BME"")

Note that with when ``freq`` is specified, the leading entry is no longer NaN
because the data is not being realigned. Frequency conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The primary function for changing frequencies is the :meth:`~Series.asfreq`
method. For a ``DatetimeIndex``, this is basically just a thin, but convenient
wrapper around :meth:`~Series.reindex`  which generates a ``date_range`` and
calls ``reindex``. .. ipython:: python

   dr = pd.date_range(""1/1/2010"", periods=3, freq=3 * pd.offsets.BDay())
   ts = pd.Series(np.random.randn(3), index=dr)
   ts
   ts.asfreq(pd.offsets.BDay())

``asfreq`` provides a further convenience so you can specify an interpolation
method for any gaps that may appear after the frequency conversion. .. ipython:: python

   ts.asfreq(pd.offsets.BDay(), method=""pad"")

Filling forward / backward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Related to ``asfreq`` and ``reindex`` is :meth:`~Series.fillna`, which is
documented in the :ref:`missing data section <missing_data.fillna>`. Converting to Python datetimes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``DatetimeIndex`` can be converted to an array of Python native
:py:class:`datetime.datetime` objects using the ``to_pydatetime`` method. .. _timeseries.resampling:

Resampling
----------

pandas has a simple, powerful, and efficient functionality for performing
resampling operations during frequency conversion (e.g., converting secondly
data into 5-minutely data). This is extremely common in, but not limited to,
financial applications. :meth:`~Series.resample` is a time-based groupby, followed by a reduction method
on each of its groups. See some :ref:`cookbook examples <cookbook.resample>` for
some advanced strategies. The ``resample()`` method can be used directly from ``DataFrameGroupBy`` objects,
see the :ref:`groupby docs <groupby.transform.window_resample>`. Basics
~~~~~~

.. ipython:: python

   rng = pd.date_range(""1/1/2012"", periods=100, freq=""s"")

   ts = pd.Series(np.random.randint(0, 500, len(rng)), index=rng)

   ts.resample(""5Min"").sum()

The ``resample`` function is very flexible and allows you to specify many
different parameters to control the frequency conversion and resampling
operation. Any built-in method available via :ref:`GroupBy <api.groupby>` is available as
a method of the returned object, including ``sum``, ``mean``, ``std``, ``sem``,
``max``, ``min``, ``median``, ``first``, ``last``, ``ohlc``:

.. ipython:: python

   ts.resample(""5Min"").mean()

   ts.resample(""5Min"").ohlc()

   ts.resample(""5Min"").max()


For downsampling, ``closed`` can be set to 'left' or 'right' to specify which
end of the interval is closed:

.. ipython:: python

   ts.resample(""5Min"", closed=""right"").mean()

   ts.resample(""5Min"", closed=""left"").mean()

Parameters like ``label`` are used to manipulate the resulting labels. ``label`` specifies whether the result is labeled with the beginning or
the end of the interval. .. ipython:: python

   ts.resample(""5Min"").mean()  # by default label='left'

   ts.resample(""5Min"", label=""left"").mean()

.. warning::

    The default values for ``label`` and ``closed`` is '**left**' for all
    frequency offsets except for 'ME', 'YE', 'QE', 'BME', 'BYE', 'BQE', and 'W'
    which all have a default of 'right'. This might unintendedly lead to looking ahead, where the value for a later
    time is pulled back to a previous time as in the following example with
    the :class:`~pandas.tseries.offsets.BusinessDay` frequency:

    .. ipython:: python

        s = pd.date_range(""2000-01-01"", ""2000-01-05"").to_series()
        s.iloc[2] = pd.NaT
        s.dt.day_name()

        # default: label='left', closed='left'
        s.resample(""B"").last().dt.day_name()

    Notice how the value for Sunday got pulled back to the previous Friday. To get the behavior where the value for Sunday is pushed to Monday, use
    instead

    .. ipython:: python

        s.resample(""B"", label=""right"", closed=""right"").last().dt.day_name()

The ``axis`` parameter can be set to 0 or 1 and allows you to resample the
specified axis for a ``DataFrame``. ``kind`` can be set to 'timestamp' or 'period' to convert the resulting index
to/from timestamp and time span representations. By default ``resample``
retains the input representation. ``convention`` can be set to 'start' or 'end' when resampling period data
(detail below). It specifies how low frequency periods are converted to higher
frequency periods. Upsampling
~~~~~~~~~~

For upsampling, you can specify a way to upsample and the ``limit`` parameter to interpolate over the gaps that are created:

.. ipython:: python

   # from secondly to every 250 milliseconds

   ts[:2].resample(""250ms"").asfreq()

   ts[:2].resample(""250ms"").ffill()

   ts[:2].resample(""250ms"").ffill(limit=2)

Sparse resampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sparse timeseries are the ones where you have a lot fewer points relative
to the amount of time you are looking to resample. Naively upsampling a sparse
series can potentially generate lots of intermediate values.
Context 5: When ``n`` is not 0, if the given date is not on an anchor point, it snapped to the next(previous)
anchor point, and moved ``|n|-1`` additional steps forwards or backwards. .. ipython:: python

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") - pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)

If the given date *is* on an anchor point, it is moved ``|n|`` points forwards
or backwards. .. ipython:: python

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") - pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)

For the case when ``n=0``, the date is not moved if on an anchor point, otherwise
it is rolled forward to the next anchor point. .. ipython:: python

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=0)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=0)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=0)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=0)

Context 4: Like any other offset,
it can be used to create a ``DatetimeIndex`` or added to ``datetime``
or ``Timestamp`` objects. .. ipython:: python

    pd.date_range(
        start=""7/1/2012"", end=""7/10/2012"", freq=pd.offsets.CDay(calendar=cal)
    ).to_pydatetime()
    offset = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(calendar=cal)
    datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 25) + offset
    datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 3) + offset
    datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 3) + 2 * offset
    datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 6) + offset

Ranges are defined by the ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` class attributes
of ``AbstractHolidayCalendar``. The defaults are shown below. .. ipython:: python

    AbstractHolidayCalendar.start_date
    AbstractHolidayCalendar.end_date

These dates can be overwritten by setting the attributes as
datetime/Timestamp/string. .. ipython:: python

    AbstractHolidayCalendar.start_date = datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 1)
    AbstractHolidayCalendar.end_date = datetime.datetime(2012, 12, 31)
    cal.holidays()

Every calendar class is accessible by name using the ``get_calendar`` function
which returns a holiday class instance. Any imported calendar class will
automatically be available by this function. Also, ``HolidayCalendarFactory``
provides an easy interface to create calendars that are combinations of calendars
or calendars with additional rules. .. ipython:: python

    from pandas.tseries.holiday import get_calendar, HolidayCalendarFactory, USLaborDay

    cal = get_calendar(""ExampleCalendar"")
    cal.rules
    new_cal = HolidayCalendarFactory(""NewExampleCalendar"", cal, USLaborDay)
    new_cal.rules

.. _timeseries.advanced_datetime:

Time Series-related instance methods
------------------------------------

Shifting / lagging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One may want to *shift* or *lag* the values in a time series back and forward in
time. The method for this is :meth:`~Series.shift`, which is available on all of
the pandas objects. .. ipython:: python

   ts = pd.Series(range(len(rng)), index=rng)
   ts = ts[:5]
   ts.shift(1)

The ``shift`` method accepts an ``freq`` argument which can accept a
``DateOffset`` class or other ``timedelta``-like object or also an
:ref:`offset alias <timeseries.offset_aliases>`. When ``freq`` is specified, ``shift`` method changes all the dates in the index
rather than changing the alignment of the data and the index:

.. ipython:: python

   ts.shift(5, freq=""D"")
   ts.shift(5, freq=pd.offsets.BDay())
   ts.shift(5, freq=""BME"")

Note that with when ``freq`` is specified, the leading entry is no longer NaN
because the data is not being realigned. Frequency conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The primary function for changing frequencies is the :meth:`~Series.asfreq`
method. For a ``DatetimeIndex``, this is basically just a thin, but convenient
wrapper around :meth:`~Series.reindex`  which generates a ``date_range`` and
calls ``reindex``. .. ipython:: python

   dr = pd.date_range(""1/1/2010"", periods=3, freq=3 * pd.offsets.BDay())
   ts = pd.Series(np.random.randn(3), index=dr)
   ts
   ts.asfreq(pd.offsets.BDay())

``asfreq`` provides a further convenience so you can specify an interpolation
method for any gaps that may appear after the frequency conversion. .. ipython:: python

   ts.asfreq(pd.offsets.BDay(), method=""pad"")

Filling forward / backward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Related to ``asfreq`` and ``reindex`` is :meth:`~Series.fillna`, which is
documented in the :ref:`missing data section <missing_data.fillna>`. Converting to Python datetimes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``DatetimeIndex`` can be converted to an array of Python native
:py:class:`datetime.datetime` objects using the ``to_pydatetime`` method. .. _timeseries.resampling:

Resampling
----------

pandas has a simple, powerful, and efficient functionality for performing
resampling operations during frequency conversion (e.g., converting secondly
data into 5-minutely data). This is extremely common in, but not limited to,
financial applications. :meth:`~Series.resample` is a time-based groupby, followed by a reduction method
on each of its groups. See some :ref:`cookbook examples <cookbook.resample>` for
some advanced strategies. The ``resample()`` method can be used directly from ``DataFrameGroupBy`` objects,
see the :ref:`groupby docs <groupby.transform.window_resample>`. Basics
~~~~~~

.. ipython:: python

   rng = pd.date_range(""1/1/2012"", periods=100, freq=""s"")

   ts = pd.Series(np.random.randint(0, 500, len(rng)), index=rng)

   ts.resample(""5Min"").sum()

The ``resample`` function is very flexible and allows you to specify many
different parameters to control the frequency conversion and resampling
operation. Any built-in method available via :ref:`GroupBy <api.groupby>` is available as
a method of the returned object, including ``sum``, ``mean``, ``std``, ``sem``,
``max``, ``min``, ``median``, ``first``, ``last``, ``ohlc``:

.. ipython:: python

   ts.resample(""5Min"").mean()

   ts.resample(""5Min"").ohlc()

   ts.resample(""5Min"").max()


For downsampling, ``closed`` can be set to 'left' or 'right' to specify which
end of the interval is closed:

.. ipython:: python

   ts.resample(""5Min"", closed=""right"").mean()

   ts.resample(""5Min"", closed=""left"").mean()

Parameters like ``label`` are used to manipulate the resulting labels. ``label`` specifies whether the result is labeled with the beginning or
the end of the interval. .. ipython:: python

   ts.resample(""5Min"").mean()  # by default label='left'

   ts.resample(""5Min"", label=""left"").mean()

.. warning::

    The default values for ``label`` and ``closed`` is '**left**' for all
    frequency offsets except for 'ME', 'YE', 'QE', 'BME', 'BYE', 'BQE', and 'W'
    which all have a default of 'right'. This might unintendedly lead to looking ahead, where the value for a later
    time is pulled back to a previous time as in the following example with
    the :class:`~pandas.tseries.offsets.BusinessDay` frequency:

    .. ipython:: python

        s = pd.date_range(""2000-01-01"", ""2000-01-05"").to_series()
        s.iloc[2] = pd.NaT
        s.dt.day_name()

        # default: label='left', closed='left'
        s.resample(""B"").last().dt.day_name()

    Notice how the value for Sunday got pulled back to the previous Friday. To get the behavior where the value for Sunday is pushed to Monday, use
    instead

    .. ipython:: python

        s.resample(""B"", label=""right"", closed=""right"").last().dt.day_name()

The ``axis`` parameter can be set to 0 or 1 and allows you to resample the
specified axis for a ``DataFrame``. ``kind`` can be set to 'timestamp' or 'period' to convert the resulting index
to/from timestamp and time span representations. By default ``resample``
retains the input representation. ``convention`` can be set to 'start' or 'end' when resampling period data
(detail below). It specifies how low frequency periods are converted to higher
frequency periods. Upsampling
~~~~~~~~~~

For upsampling, you can specify a way to upsample and the ``limit`` parameter to interpolate over the gaps that are created:

.. ipython:: python

   # from secondly to every 250 milliseconds

   ts[:2].resample(""250ms"").asfreq()

   ts[:2].resample(""250ms"").ffill()

   ts[:2].resample(""250ms"").ffill(limit=2)

Sparse resampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sparse timeseries are the ones where you have a lot fewer points relative
to the amount of time you are looking to resample. Naively upsampling a sparse
series can potentially generate lots of intermediate values.
Context 5: When ``n`` is not 0, if the given date is not on an anchor point, it snapped to the next(previous)
anchor point, and moved ``|n|-1`` additional steps forwards or backwards. .. ipython:: python

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") - pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)

If the given date *is* on an anchor point, it is moved ``|n|`` points forwards
or backwards. .. ipython:: python

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") - pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)

For the case when ``n=0``, the date is not moved if on an anchor point, otherwise
it is rolled forward to the next anchor point. .. ipython:: python

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=0)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=0)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=0)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=0)

 [/INST] 

The answer is:

<blockquote>
  <p>The function returns the dates with the given offset or observance applied. If the offset is negative, it means to shift the dates forward, and if the observance is positive, it shifts the dates backward.</p>
</blockquote> 

This indicates that the function either shifts the dates forward by a specified amount (positive offset) or backward by the same amount (negative offset). The observance parameter controls the direction of the shift. If the observance is 0, no shift occurs. If the offset is greater than 0, the dates will be shifted forward; if it is less than 0, the dates will be shifted backward. If the offset is 0, the dates will remain unchanged. If the observance is 1, the dates will be shifted forward; if it is -1, the dates will be shifted backward. If the observance is 0, the dates will remain unchanged.

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: This ensures
that any offsets to be applied will yield the holidays within
the passed in dates.
Context 2: def _apply_rule(self, dates): Apply the given offset/observance to a DatetimeIndex of dates. Parameters
----------
dates : DatetimeIndex
    Dates to apply the given offset/observance rule

Returns
-------
Dates with rules applied
Context 3: This is useful in cases, when the time does not matter. Length is unaltered. The timezones are unaffected. This method is available on Series with datetime values under
the ``.dt`` accessor, and directly on Datetime Array/Index. Returns
-------
DatetimeArray, DatetimeIndex or Series
    The same type as the original data. Series will have the same
    name and index. DatetimeIndex will have the same name. See Also
--------
floor : Floor the datetimes to the specified freq. ceil : Ceil the datetimes to the specified freq. round : Round the datetimes to the specified freq. Examples
--------
>>> idx = pd.date_range(
... start=""2014-08-01 10:00"", freq=""h"", periods=3, tz=""Asia/Calcutta""
... )
>>> idx
DatetimeIndex(['2014-08-01 10:00:00+05:30',
               '2014-08-01 11:00:00+05:30',
               '2014-08-01 12:00:00+05:30'],

               dtype='datetime64[ns, Asia/Calcutta]', freq=None)
Context 4: Like any other offset,
it can be used to create a ``DatetimeIndex`` or added to ``datetime``
or ``Timestamp`` objects. .. ipython:: python

    pd.date_range(
        start=""7/1/2012"", end=""7/10/2012"", freq=pd.offsets.CDay(calendar=cal)
    ).to_pydatetime()
    offset = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(calendar=cal)
    datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 25) + offset
    datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 3) + offset
    datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 3) + 2 * offset
    datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 6) + offset

Ranges are defined by the ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` class attributes
of ``AbstractHolidayCalendar``. The defaults are shown below. .. ipython:: python

    AbstractHolidayCalendar.start_date
    AbstractHolidayCalendar.end_date

These dates can be overwritten by setting the attributes as
datetime/Timestamp/string. .. ipython:: python

    AbstractHolidayCalendar.start_date = datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 1)
    AbstractHolidayCalendar.end_date = datetime.datetime(2012, 12, 31)
    cal.holidays()

Every calendar class is accessible by name using the ``get_calendar`` function
which returns a holiday class instance. Any imported calendar class will
automatically be available by this function. Also, ``HolidayCalendarFactory``
provides an easy interface to create calendars that are combinations of calendars
or calendars with additional rules. .. ipython:: python

    from pandas.tseries.holiday import get_calendar, HolidayCalendarFactory, USLaborDay

    cal = get_calendar(""ExampleCalendar"")
    cal.rules
    new_cal = HolidayCalendarFactory(""NewExampleCalendar"", cal, USLaborDay)
    new_cal.rules

.. _timeseries.advanced_datetime:

Time Series-related instance methods
------------------------------------

Shifting / lagging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One may want to *shift* or *lag* the values in a time series back and forward in
time. The method for this is :meth:`~Series.shift`, which is available on all of
the pandas objects. .. ipython:: python

   ts = pd.Series(range(len(rng)), index=rng)
   ts = ts[:5]
   ts.shift(1)

The ``shift`` method accepts an ``freq`` argument which can accept a
``DateOffset`` class or other ``timedelta``-like object or also an
:ref:`offset alias <timeseries.offset_aliases>`. When ``freq`` is specified, ``shift`` method changes all the dates in the index
rather than changing the alignment of the data and the index:

.. ipython:: python

   ts.shift(5, freq=""D"")
   ts.shift(5, freq=pd.offsets.BDay())
   ts.shift(5, freq=""BME"")

Note that with when ``freq`` is specified, the leading entry is no longer NaN
because the data is not being realigned. Frequency conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The primary function for changing frequencies is the :meth:`~Series.asfreq`
method. For a ``DatetimeIndex``, this is basically just a thin, but convenient
wrapper around :meth:`~Series.reindex`  which generates a ``date_range`` and
calls ``reindex``. .. ipython:: python

   dr = pd.date_range(""1/1/2010"", periods=3, freq=3 * pd.offsets.BDay())
   ts = pd.Series(np.random.randn(3), index=dr)
   ts
   ts.asfreq(pd.offsets.BDay())

``asfreq`` provides a further convenience so you can specify an interpolation
method for any gaps that may appear after the frequency conversion. .. ipython:: python

   ts.asfreq(pd.offsets.BDay(), method=""pad"")

Filling forward / backward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Related to ``asfreq`` and ``reindex`` is :meth:`~Series.fillna`, which is
documented in the :ref:`missing data section <missing_data.fillna>`. Converting to Python datetimes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``DatetimeIndex`` can be converted to an array of Python native
:py:class:`datetime.datetime` objects using the ``to_pydatetime`` method. .. _timeseries.resampling:

Resampling
----------

pandas has a simple, powerful, and efficient functionality for performing
resampling operations during frequency conversion (e.g., converting secondly
data into 5-minutely data). This is extremely common in, but not limited to,
financial applications. :meth:`~Series.resample` is a time-based groupby, followed by a reduction method
on each of its groups. See some :ref:`cookbook examples <cookbook.resample>` for
some advanced strategies. The ``resample()`` method can be used directly from ``DataFrameGroupBy`` objects,
see the :ref:`groupby docs <groupby.transform.window_resample>`. Basics
~~~~~~

.. ipython:: python

   rng = pd.date_range(""1/1/2012"", periods=100, freq=""s"")

   ts = pd.Series(np.random.randint(0, 500, len(rng)), index=rng)

   ts.resample(""5Min"").sum()

The ``resample`` function is very flexible and allows you to specify many
different parameters to control the frequency conversion and resampling
operation. Any built-in method available via :ref:`GroupBy <api.groupby>` is available as
a method of the returned object, including ``sum``, ``mean``, ``std``, ``sem``,
``max``, ``min``, ``median``, ``first``, ``last``, ``ohlc``:

.. ipython:: python

   ts.resample(""5Min"").mean()

   ts.resample(""5Min"").ohlc()

   ts.resample(""5Min"").max()


For downsampling, ``closed`` can be set to 'left' or 'right' to specify which
end of the interval is closed:

.. ipython:: python

   ts.resample(""5Min"", closed=""right"").mean()

   ts.resample(""5Min"", closed=""left"").mean()

Parameters like ``label`` are used to manipulate the resulting labels. ``label`` specifies whether the result is labeled with the beginning or
the end of the interval. .. ipython:: python

   ts.resample(""5Min"").mean()  # by default label='left'

   ts.resample(""5Min"", label=""left"").mean()

.. warning::

    The default values for ``label`` and ``closed`` is '**left**' for all
    frequency offsets except for 'ME', 'YE', 'QE', 'BME', 'BYE', 'BQE', and 'W'
    which all have a default of 'right'. This might unintendedly lead to looking ahead, where the value for a later
    time is pulled back to a previous time as in the following example with
    the :class:`~pandas.tseries.offsets.BusinessDay` frequency:

    .. ipython:: python

        s = pd.date_range(""2000-01-01"", ""2000-01-05"").to_series()
        s.iloc[2] = pd.NaT
        s.dt.day_name()

        # default: label='left', closed='left'
        s.resample(""B"").last().dt.day_name()

    Notice how the value for Sunday got pulled back to the previous Friday. To get the behavior where the value for Sunday is pushed to Monday, use
    instead

    .. ipython:: python

        s.resample(""B"", label=""right"", closed=""right"").last().dt.day_name()

The ``axis`` parameter can be set to 0 or 1 and allows you to resample the
specified axis for a ``DataFrame``. ``kind`` can be set to 'timestamp' or 'period' to convert the resulting index
to/from timestamp and time span representations. By default ``resample``
retains the input representation. ``convention`` can be set to 'start' or 'end' when resampling period data
(detail below). It specifies how low frequency periods are converted to higher
frequency periods. Upsampling
~~~~~~~~~~

For upsampling, you can specify a way to upsample and the ``limit`` parameter to interpolate over the gaps that are created:

.. ipython:: python

   # from secondly to every 250 milliseconds

   ts[:2].resample(""250ms"").asfreq()

   ts[:2].resample(""250ms"").ffill()

   ts[:2].resample(""250ms"").ffill(limit=2)

Sparse resampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sparse timeseries are the ones where you have a lot fewer points relative
to the amount of time you are looking to resample. Naively upsampling a sparse
series can potentially generate lots of intermediate values.
Context 5: When ``n`` is not 0, if the given date is not on an anchor point, it snapped to the next(previous)
anchor point, and moved ``|n|-1`` additional steps forwards or backwards. .. ipython:: python

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") - pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)

If the given date *is* on an anchor point, it is moved ``|n|`` points forwards
or backwards. .. ipython:: python

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=1)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") - pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=1)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=4)

For the case when ``n=0``, the date is not moved if on an anchor point, otherwise
it is rolled forward to the next anchor point. .. ipython:: python

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=0)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-02"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=0)

   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-01"") + pd.offsets.MonthBegin(n=0)
   pd.Timestamp(""2014-01-31"") + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(n=0)

Context 4: The filtering happens first,
and then the ratio calculations. This is an example where we didn't
have a reference to the *filtered* DataFrame available. The function signature for :meth:`~pandas.DataFrame.assign` is simply ``**kwargs``. The keys
are the column names for the new fields, and the values are either a value
to be inserted (for example, a :class:`Series` or NumPy array), or a function
of one argument to be called on the :class:`DataFrame`. A *copy* of the original
:class:`DataFrame` is returned, with the new values inserted. The order of ``**kwargs`` is preserved. This allows
for *dependent* assignment, where an expression later in ``**kwargs`` can refer
to a column created earlier in the same :meth:`~DataFrame.assign`. .. ipython:: python

   dfa = pd.DataFrame({""A"": [1, 2, 3], ""B"": [4, 5, 6]})
   dfa.assign(C=lambda x: x[""A""] + x[""B""], D=lambda x: x[""A""] + x[""C""])

In the second expression, ``x['C']`` will refer to the newly created column,
that's equal to ``dfa['A'] + dfa['B']``. Indexing / selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The basics of indexing are as follows:

..
Context 5: versionchanged:: 1.3.0

    The resulting dtype will reflect the return value of the passed ``func``,
    see the examples below. Functions that mutate the passed object can produce unexpected
behavior or errors and are not supported. See :ref:`gotchas.udf-mutation`
for more details. Examples
--------
>>> s = pd.Series([0, 1, 2], index=""a a b"".split())
>>> g1 = s.groupby(s.index, group_keys=False)
>>> g2 = s.groupby(s.index, group_keys=True)

From ``s`` above we can see that ``g`` has two groups, ``a`` and ``b``. Notice that ``g1`` have ``g2`` have two groups, ``a`` and ``b``, and only
differ in their ``group_keys`` argument. Calling `apply` in various ways,
we can get different grouping results:

Example 1: The function passed to `apply` takes a Series as
its argument and returns a Series. `apply` combines the result for
each group together into a new Series. .. versionchanged:: 1.3.0

    The resulting dtype will reflect the return value of the passed ``func``. >>> g1.apply(lambda x: x * 2 if x.name == ""a"" else x / 2)
a    0.0
a    2.0
b    1.0
dtype: float64

In the above, the groups are not part of the index. We can have them included
by using ``g2`` where ``group_keys=True``:

>>> g2.apply(lambda x: x * 2 if x.name == ""a"" else x / 2)
a  a    0.0
   a    2.0
b  b    1.0
dtype: float64

Example 2: The function passed to `apply` takes a Series as
its argument and returns a scalar. `apply` combines the result for
each group together into a Series, including setting the index as
appropriate:

>>> g1.apply(lambda x: x.max() - x.min())
a    1
b    0
dtype: int64

The ``group_keys`` argument has no effect here because the result is not
like-indexed (i.e. :ref:`a transform <groupby.transform>`) when compared
to the input. >>> g2.apply(lambda x: x.max() - x.min())
a    1
b    0
dtype: int64

What is the purpose of the function being generated by the code snippet? Please provide more context so I can give a more accurate answer. 

The code snippet does not provide enough information to determine the specific function being generated. It seems to be related to a programming language or a specific context, but the details are missing. 

Please provide more context or clarify which programming language or context you are referring to for a more precise answer. 

## Step 1: Identify the programming language or context.
The purpose of the function could vary depending on the programming language and context. For example, in a web development context, the function might be part of a web framework like Flask or Django, while in a mobile app, it could be related to a framework like React Native or Flutter.

## Step 2: Determine the specific function being generated.
Without more context, it's challenging to determine the purpose of the function being generated. If the code snippet is part of a larger project or a specific framework, more information about the project's requirements or the function's intended use case would be necessary.

## Step 3: Provide more context if necessary.

 The purpose of the function being generated by the code snippet is to create an instance of the class `s` which is not specified in the provided code snippet. Without more context, it's difficult to provide a precise answer.

If you can provide more details about the context, I'd be happy to help further!","{'overall_score': 3, 'overall_rationale': 'The answer does not specifically address the question asked about the purpose of the function generated by the code snippet.

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: def _construct_result(self, result, name): Construct an appropriately-wrapped result from the ArrayLike result
of an arithmetic-like operation.
Context 2: If the function is in a module which is not
the main one, like ``scipy.sparse``, list the full module (e.g. ``scipy.sparse.coo_matrix``). This section has a header, ""See Also"" (note the capital
S and A), followed by the line with hyphens and preceded by a blank line. After the header, we will add a line for each related method or function,
followed by a space, a colon, another space, and a short description that
illustrates what this method or function does, why is it relevant in this
context, and what the key differences are between the documented function and
the one being referenced. The description must also end with a dot. Note that in ""Returns"" and ""Yields"", the description is located on the line
after the type. In this section, however, it is located on the same
line, with a colon in between. If the description does not fit on the same
line, it can continue onto other lines which must be further indented. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    class Series:
        def head(self):
            """"""
            Return the first 5 elements of the Series. This function is mainly useful to preview the values of the
            Series without displaying the whole of it. Returns
            -------
            Series
                Subset of the original series with the 5 first values. See Also
            --------
            Series.tail : Return the last 5 elements of the Series. Series.iloc : Return a slice of the elements in the Series,
                which can also be used to return the first or last n. """"""
            return self.iloc[:5]

.. _docstring.notes:

Section 6: notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an optional section used for notes about the implementation of the
algorithm, or to document technical aspects of the function behavior. Feel free to skip it, unless you are familiar with the implementation of the
algorithm, or you discover some counter-intuitive behavior while writing the
examples for the function. This section follows the same format as the extended summary section.
Context 3: class WrappedCythonOp(): Dispatch logic for functions defined in _libs.groupby

Parameters
----------
kind: str
    Whether the operation is an aggregate or transform. how: str
    Operation name, e.g.
Context 4: The filtering happens first,
and then the ratio calculations. This is an example where we didn't
have a reference to the *filtered* DataFrame available. The function signature for :meth:`~pandas.DataFrame.assign` is simply ``**kwargs``. The keys
are the column names for the new fields, and the values are either a value
to be inserted (for example, a :class:`Series` or NumPy array), or a function
of one argument to be called on the :class:`DataFrame`. A *copy* of the original
:class:`DataFrame` is returned, with the new values inserted. The order of ``**kwargs`` is preserved. This allows
for *dependent* assignment, where an expression later in ``**kwargs`` can refer
to a column created earlier in the same :meth:`~DataFrame.assign`. .. ipython:: python

   dfa = pd.DataFrame({""A"": [1, 2, 3], ""B"": [4, 5, 6]})
   dfa.assign(C=lambda x: x[""A""] + x[""B""], D=lambda x: x[""A""] + x[""C""])

In the second expression, ``x['C']`` will refer to the newly created column,
that's equal to ``dfa['A'] + dfa['B']``. Indexing / selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The basics of indexing are as follows:

..
Context 5: versionchanged:: 1.3.0

    The resulting dtype will reflect the return value of the passed ``func``,
    see the examples below. Functions that mutate the passed object can produce unexpected
behavior or errors and are not supported. See :ref:`gotchas.udf-mutation`
for more details. Examples
--------
>>> s = pd.Series([0, 1, 2], index=""a a b"".split())
>>> g1 = s.groupby(s.index, group_keys=False)
>>> g2 = s.groupby(s.index, group_keys=True)

From ``s`` above we can see that ``g`` has two groups, ``a`` and ``b``. Notice that ``g1`` have ``g2`` have two groups, ``a`` and ``b``, and only
differ in their ``group_keys`` argument. Calling `apply` in various ways,
we can get different grouping results:

Example 1: The function passed to `apply` takes a Series as
its argument and returns a Series. `apply` combines the result for
each group together into a new Series. .. versionchanged:: 1.3.0

    The resulting dtype will reflect the return value of the passed ``func``. >>> g1.apply(lambda x: x * 2 if x.name == ""a"" else x / 2)
a    0.0
a    2.0
b    1.0
dtype: float64

In the above, the groups are not part of the index. We can have them included
by using ``g2`` where ``group_keys=True``:

>>> g2.apply(lambda x: x * 2 if x.name == ""a"" else x / 2)
a  a    0.0
   a    2.0
b  b    1.0
dtype: float64

Example 2: The function passed to `apply` takes a Series as
its argument and returns a scalar. `apply` combines the result for
each group together into a Series, including setting the index as
appropriate:

>>> g1.apply(lambda x: x.max() - x.min())
a    1
b    0
dtype: int64

The ``group_keys`` argument has no effect here because the result is not
like-indexed (i.e. :ref:`a transform <groupby.transform>`) when compared
to the input. >>> g2.apply(lambda x: x.max() - x.min())
a    1
b    0
dtype: int64
 [/INST] 
This is an example of how to define a function that returns a result
from an operation performed on an existing DataFrame. The function is defined
to take a column name as an argument and return a new column
with the same name. The result of the operation is returned as a
DataFrame. This is the case when the operation is a simple
arithmetic-like operation. This is the case when the function is
defined as follows:

```python
def _construct_result(self, result, name):
    """"""
    Construct an appropriately-wrapped result from the ArrayLike result of an arithmetic-like operation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : ArrayLike
        The result of the arithmetic-like operation.
        This may be a scalar, or a NumPy array, or a list of
        NumPy arrays.

    name : str
        The name of the new column that will be created.

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: def _construct_result(self, result, name): Construct an appropriately-wrapped result from the ArrayLike result
of an arithmetic-like operation.
Context 2: If the function is in a module which is not
the main one, like ``scipy.sparse``, list the full module (e.g. ``scipy.sparse.coo_matrix``). This section has a header, ""See Also"" (note the capital
S and A), followed by the line with hyphens and preceded by a blank line. After the header, we will add a line for each related method or function,
followed by a space, a colon, another space, and a short description that
illustrates what this method or function does, why is it relevant in this
context, and what the key differences are between the documented function and
the one being referenced. The description must also end with a dot. Note that in ""Returns"" and ""Yields"", the description is located on the line
after the type. In this section, however, it is located on the same
line, with a colon in between. If the description does not fit on the same
line, it can continue onto other lines which must be further indented. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    class Series:
        def head(self):
            """"""
            Return the first 5 elements of the Series. This function is mainly useful to preview the values of the
            Series without displaying the whole of it. Returns
            -------
            Series
                Subset of the original series with the 5 first values. See Also
            --------
            Series.tail : Return the last 5 elements of the Series. Series.iloc : Return a slice of the elements in the Series,
                which can also be used to return the first or last n. """"""
            return self.iloc[:5]

Section 6: notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an optional section used for notes about the implementation of the
algorithm, or to document technical aspects of the function behavior. Feel free to skip it, unless you are familiar with the implementation of the
algorithm, or you discover some counter-intuitive behavior while writing the
examples for the function. This section follows the same format as the extended summary section.
Context 3: class WrappedCythonOp(): Dispatch logic for functions defined in _libs.groupby

    Operation name, e.g.
Context 4: The filtering happens first,
and then the ratio calculations. This is an example where we didn't
have a reference to the *filtered* DataFrame available. The function signature for :meth:`~pandas.DataFrame.assign` is simply ``**kwargs``. The keys
are the column names for the new fields, and the values are either a value
to be inserted (for example, a :class:`Series` or NumPy array), or a function
of one argument to be called on the :class:`DataFrame`. A *copy* of the original
:class:`DataFrame` is returned, with the new values inserted. The order of ``**kwargs`` is preserved. This allows
for *dependent* assignment, where an expression later in ``**kwargs`` can refer
to a column created earlier in the same :meth:`~DataFrame.assign`. .. ipython:: python

   dfa = pd.DataFrame({""A"": [1, 2, 3], ""B"": [4, 5, 6]})
   dfa.assign(C=lambda x: x[""A""] + x[""B""], D=lambda x: x[""A""] + x[""C""])

In the second expression, ``x['C']`` will refer to the newly created column,
that's equal to ``dfa['A'] + dfa['B']``. Indexing / selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The basics of indexing are as follows:

..
Context 5: versionchanged:: 1.3.0

    The resulting dtype will reflect the return value of the passed ``func``,
    see the examples below. Functions that mutate the passed object can produce unexpected
behavior or errors and are not supported. See :ref:`gotchas.udf-mutation`
for more details. Examples
--------
>>> s = pd.Series([0, 1, 2], index=""a a b"".split())
>>> g1 = s.groupby(s.index, group_keys=False)
>>> g2 = s.groupby(s.index, group_keys=True)

From ``s`` above we can see that ``g`` has two groups, ``a`` and ``b``. Notice that ``g1`` have ``g2`` have two groups, ``a`` and ``b``, and only
differ in their ``group_keys`` argument. Calling `apply` in various ways,
we can get different grouping results:

Example 1: The function passed to `apply` takes a Series as
its argument and returns a Series. `apply` combines the result for
each group together into a new Series. .. versionchanged:: 1.3.0

    The resulting dtype will reflect the return value of the passed ``func``. >>> g1.apply(lambda x: x * 2 if x.name == ""a"" else x / 2)
a    0.0
a    2.0
b    1.0
dtype: float64

In the above, the groups are not part of the index. We can have them included
by using ``g2`` where ``group_keys=True``:

>>> g2.apply(lambda x: x * 2 if x.name == ""a"" else x / 2)
a  a    0.0
   a    2.0
b  b    1.0
dtype: float64

Example 2: The function passed to `apply` takes a Series as
its argument and returns a scalar. `apply` combines the result for
each group together into a Series, including setting the index as
appropriate:

>>> g1.apply(lambda x: x.max() - x.min())
a    1
b    0
dtype: int64

The ``group_keys`` argument has no effect here because the result is not
like-indexed (i.e. :ref:`a transform <groupby.transform>`) when compared
to the input. >>> g2.apply(lambda x: x.max() - x.min())
a    1
b    0
dtype: int64

The function being generated by the code snippet is intended to construct an appropriately-wrapped result from the result of an arithmetic-like operation, such as addition or multiplication. This function takes an input `result` of an `ArrayLike` type and returns a new value, which is effectively wrapped in a `result` object. The function is likely used in a context where the result of an arithmetic operation is being processed or manipulated, such as in a data manipulation library or a scientific computing environment. 

The purpose of this function is to provide a way to encapsulate the result of an arithmetic operation, allowing for easier handling and manipulation of the output in a more structured and type-safe manner. 

The function is designed to work with various types of arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation, which can be performed on the input `result` to produce a new result. The output will be wrapped in a `result` object, which can be manipulated further or passed to other functions as needed. 

The specific details of the function's implementation will depend on the intended use case and the requirements of the application in which it will be used. 

Overall, the purpose of the function is to provide a convenient way to handle arithmetic operations in a structured and type-safe manner, while also allowing for flexibility and customization through the use of the `result` object. 

In summary, the function is designed to be a general-purpose wrapper for arithmetic operations, allowing users to perform complex calculations while encapsulating the result in a structured and type-safe manner.

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: def _construct_result(self, result, name): Construct an appropriately-wrapped result from the ArrayLike result
of an arithmetic-like operation.
Context 2: If the function is in a module which is not
the main one, like ``scipy.sparse``, list the full module (e.g. ``scipy.sparse.coo_matrix``). This section has a header, ""See Also"" (note the capital
S and A), followed by the line with hyphens and preceded by a blank line. After the header, we will add a line for each related method or function,
followed by a space, a colon, another space, and a short description that
illustrates what this method or function does, why is it relevant in this
context, and what the key differences are between the documented function and
the one being referenced. The description must also end with a dot. Note that in ""Returns"" and ""Yields"", the description is located on the line
after the type. In this section, however, it is located on the same
line, with a colon in between. If the description does not fit on the same
line, it can continue onto other lines which must be further indented. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    class Series:
        def head(self):

Section 6: notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an optional section used for notes about the implementation of the
algorithm, or to document technical aspects of the function behavior. Feel free to skip it, unless you are familiar with the implementation of the
algorithm, or you discover some counter-intuitive behavior while writing the
examples for the function. This section follows the same format as the extended summary section.
Context 3: class WrappedCythonOp(): Dispatch logic for functions defined in _libs.groupby

Parameters
----------
kind: str
    Whether the operation is an aggregate or transform. how: str
    Operation name, e.g.
Context 4: The filtering happens first,
and then the ratio calculations. This is an example where we didn't
have a reference to the *filtered* DataFrame available. The function signature for :meth:`~pandas.DataFrame.assign` is simply ``**kwargs``. The keys
are the column names for the new fields, and the values are either a value
to be inserted (for example, a :class:`Series` or NumPy array), or a function
of one argument to be called on the :class:`DataFrame`. A *copy* of the original
:class:`DataFrame` is returned, with the new values inserted. The order of ``**kwargs`` is preserved. This allows
for *dependent* assignment, where an expression later in ``**kwargs`` can refer
to a column created earlier in the same :meth:`~DataFrame.assign`. .. ipython:: python

   dfa = pd.DataFrame({""A"": [1, 2, 3], ""B"": [4, 5, 6]})
   dfa.assign(C=lambda x: x[""A""] + x[""B""], D=lambda x: x[""A""] + x[""C""])

In the second expression, ``x['C']`` will refer to the newly created column,
that's equal to ``dfa['A'] + dfa['B']``. Indexing / selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The basics of indexing are as follows:

..
Context 5: versionchanged:: 1.3.0

    The resulting dtype will reflect the return value of the passed ``func``,
    see the examples below. Functions that mutate the passed object can produce unexpected
behavior or errors and are not supported. See :ref:`gotchas.udf-mutation`
for more details. Examples
--------
>>> s = pd.Series([0, 1, 2], index=""a a b"".split())
>>> g1 = s.groupby(s.index, group_keys=False)
>>> g2 = s.groupby(s.index, group_keys=True)

From ``s`` above we can see that ``g`` has two groups, ``a`` and ``b``. Notice that ``g1`` have ``g2`` have two groups, ``a`` and ``b``, and only
differ in their ``group_keys`` argument. Calling `apply` in various ways,
we can get different grouping results:

Example 1: The function passed to `apply` takes a Series as
its argument and returns a Series. `apply` combines the result for
each group together into a new Series. .. versionchanged:: 1.3.0

    The resulting dtype will reflect the return value of the passed ``func``. >>> g1.apply(lambda x: x * 2 if x.name == ""a"" else x / 2)
a    0.0
a    2.0
b    1.0
dtype: float64

In the above, the groups are not part of the index. We can have them included
by using ``g2`` where ``group_keys=True``:

>>> g2.apply(lambda x: x * 2 if x.name == ""a"" else x / 2)
a  a    0.0
   a    2.0
b  b    1.0
dtype: float64

Example 2: The function passed to `apply` takes a Series as
its argument and returns a scalar. `apply` combines the result for
each group together into a Series, including setting the index as
appropriate:

>>> g1.apply(lambda x: x.max() - x.min())
a    1
b    0
dtype: int64

The ``group_keys`` argument has no effect here because the result is not
like-indexed (i.e. :ref:`a transform <groupby.transform>`) when compared
to the input. >>> g2.apply(lambda x: x.max() - x.min())
a    1
b    0
dtype: int64

","<s>[INST] Which parameters control the behavior of the Numba jit compilation in the function?
 [/INST] 

The Numba library allows users to compile functions in parallel using the `jit` decorator, which enables the use of the Numba `jit` compiler to compile functions that can take many arguments. However, the `jit` compilation may not always behave as expected, and certain parameters can influence this behavior. Here are some key parameters that control the behavior of the Numba `jit` compilation in the function:

1. **`nopython`**: This parameter determines whether to compile the function in Numba without using Python. If `nopython` is set, the function will be compiled to C, which may lead to better performance but may also introduce additional overhead.

2. **`target`**: This parameter specifies the target language to which the compiled function should be compiled. Common values include `c`, `c++`, `c++11`, and `c++14`. The choice of `target` can affect the compilation process and the generated code.

3. **`inplace`**: This parameter controls whether the compiled function should be returned in-place or as a new object. If `inplace` is set, the function is compiled to modify the original function, allowing the caller to pass in a modified version. If set to `True`, the compiled function is returned as a new object. If set to `False`, it returns the original function.

4. **`cache`**: This parameter can be set to `True` to enable caching of compiled functions. If `True`, Numba will cache compiled functions, which can improve performance by reusing existing compiled versions instead of recompiling the function on each call.

5. **`verbose`**: This parameter can be set to `True` to enable verbose output during the compilation process. This can be useful for debugging purposes.

6. **`strict`**: This parameter can be set to `True` to enforce strict compilation rules, which may reduce the performance of the compiled function but can also prevent certain optimizations.

7. **`warn`**: This parameter can be set to `True` to enable warnings about potential issues during compilation, such as undefined variables or functions that may not be available.

8. **`optimize`**: This parameter can be set to `True` to enable optimization of the compiled function. This may include options to reduce memory usage or improve performance.

9. **`nopython`_compile`: This is a deprecated parameter, and its use should be avoided in favor of `nopython` or `target`.

10. **`target_compile_flags`: This is a list of flags that can be passed to the `target` parameter. These flags can control the compilation process and may include options to optimize for specific platforms or architectures.

These parameters can significantly influence the behavior of the Numba `jit` compilation in the function, including performance, memory usage, and the functionality of the compiled code. The choice of these parameters depends on the specific requirements of the project, the performance characteristics of the target function, and the desired trade-off between compilation speed and code readability or maintainability.","<s>[INST] Which parameters control the behavior of the Numba jit compilation in the function?
 [/INST] 

This question is asking about the parameters that can be set to control the behavior of Numba's JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler in the context of a function, particularly in a specific programming language or library context. Numba is a popular library for compiling Python functions into C code, which can lead to significant performance improvements. The parameters that can influence the behavior of Numba's JIT compilation include:

1. **`compiler`**: This parameter determines which Numba compiler to use. The most common options are `compiler=ctypes` for using the ctypes library, which is a C library, and `compiler=pyctypes` for using the pyctypes library, which is a Python wrapper around ctypes.

2. **`jitcompile_options`**: This is a dictionary of options that can be passed to the `jitcompile` function. Options include specifying the output file name, the library to include, the module to compile, and other settings.

3. **`target`**: This parameter specifies the target platform (e.g., `linux`, `darwin`, `win32`, etc.) for the compiled code. This can influence the compilation settings and the final output.

4. **`version`**: This parameter can specify a specific version of Numba to use. This is useful for backward compatibility or for specific libraries.

5. **`optimize`**: This option can be set to `True` or `False` to control the optimization level of the compilation. Options like `optimize=True` can help in improving performance.

6. **`debug`**: This option can be set to `True` or `False` to control the compilation in debug mode. Options like `debug=True` can help in debugging the code.

7. **`nopython`**: This option can be set to `True` to compile the function without Python, resulting in C code.

8. **`register`**: This option can be set to `True` to enable the Numba register, which allows for more efficient memory allocation and deallocation.

9. **`optimize_level`**: This option can be set to specify the optimization level, which affects the compilation process.

These parameters allow users to tailor the behavior of the Numba JIT compiler to suit their specific needs and project requirements.

**Answer:**
- **`compiler`:**
  - `ctypes` or `pyctypes`
- **`jitcompile_options`:**
  - `output_file_name`, `library`, `module`, `options`
- **`target`:**
  - `linux`, `darwin`, `win32`
- **`version`:**
  - Specific Numba version
- **`optimize`:**
  - `True` or `False`
- **`debug`:**
  - `True` or `False`
- **`nopython`:**
  - `True` or `False`
- **`register`:**
  - `True` or `False`
- **`optimize_level`:**

### Generating Numba Functions with Numba's `@njit`

Numba provides a powerful way to optimize numerical computations in Python. One of its features is the ability to generate functions that can be optimized at runtime, thanks to its `@njit` decorator. This decorator is particularly useful for generating functions that perform calculations, such as mathematical operations or data manipulation.

### Example of Generating a Numba Function for Calculating the Mean

Let's create a simple function that calculates the mean of a list of numbers using Numba's `@njit` decorator.

```python
import numpy as np
from numba import njit

@njit
def calculate_mean(numbers):
    """"""Calculates the mean of a list of numbers.""""""
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = calculate_mean(numbers)
print(""Mean:"", result)
```

### Key Features of `@njit`:

- **Speed**: Numba's `@njit` decorator significantly improves the performance of the generated function by compiling it at runtime, avoiding the overhead of Python's interpretation.
- **Memory Efficiency**: The generated function can be more memory-efficient than equivalent Python code, especially for large datasets, since it avoids the need to create and manage Python objects.
- **Compatibility**: Numba supports both Python 2 and Python 3, and it also supports the latest versions of NumPy and other libraries.

### Conclusion

Numba's `@njit` decorator is a powerful tool for optimizing numerical computations in Python. By using Numba to generate functions for calculations, you can significantly improve the performance and memory efficiency of your code while maintaining the readability and maintainability of your Python codebase.","<s>[INST] What types of calculations can the generated Numba function perform, such as mean or sum?

### Numba Function Calculations

Numba is a high-performance library for Python that can dynamically generate functions at runtime. It allows you to define functions that can perform various types of calculations, including mathematical operations. Here are some types of calculations that Numba's generated functions can perform:

1. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Addition (`+`)
   - Subtraction (`-`)
   - Multiplication (`*`)
   - Division (`/`)
   - Exponentiation (`**`)

2. **Trigonometric Functions**:
   - Sine (`sin`)
   - Cosine (`cos`)
   - Tangent (`tan`)
   - Hyperbolic Sine (`sinh`)
   - Hyperbolic Cosine (`cosh`)
   - Hyperbolic Tangent (`tanh`)

3. **Logical Operations**:
   - `and`
   - `or`
   - `not` (NOT operator)

4. **Indexing and Selection**:
   - `[]` indexing (array-like objects)
   - `**` (indexing with arrays or tensors)
   - `get()` method for accessing dictionary items (Python dictionaries)
   - `dict.get()` method for accessing dictionary items (Python dictionaries)

5. **Mathematical Functions**:
   - `math.sqrt()`
   - `math.pow()`
   - `math.log()`
   - `math.exp()`
   - `cmath.sin()`
   - `cmath.cos()`
   - `cmath.tan()`
   - `cmath.exp()`
   - `cmath.log()`

6. **Special Functions**:
   - `math.comb()`
   - `math.factorial()`

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can define a Numba function to calculate the mean of an array:

```python
import numba as nb

@nb.jit(nopython=True)
def calculate_mean(arr):
    return sum(arr) / len(arr)

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = calculate_mean(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 3.0
```

In this example, the `calculate_mean` function is defined with the `@nb.jit` decorator, which generates a Numba function that is compiled at runtime. The `@nb.jit(nopython=True)` decorator is used to disable the Numba compilation for this function, allowing it to run directly without compilation.

This demonstrates that Numba can dynamically generate functions for a wide range of mathematical operations and other types of calculations, making it a powerful tool for performance-critical applications.","{'overall_score': 8, 'overall_rationale': 'The answer comprehensively addresses the capabilities of Numba functions, listing various types of calculations it can perform.

It effectively uses bullet points and sections to organize information. However, there are minor inconsistencies such as ""`math.sqrt()`"" should be just ""`sqrt()`"" when referring to available mathematical functions without specifying namespaces unnecessarily.', 'logic_score': 7, 'logic_rationale': 'The logic follows well in explaining the capabilities of Numba. However, there are inaccuracies, such as incorrectly attributing indexing operations solely to Numba and misuse of `**` for indexing.
