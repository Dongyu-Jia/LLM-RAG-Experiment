### Usage Examples

1. **Date Manipulation**

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Create a Series of dates
   dates = pd.Series(['2022-01-01', '2022-01-02', '2022-01-03'])

   # Create a TimedeltaArray for the dates
   date_timedelta = pd.TimedeltaArray(dates)

   # Calculate the difference between each date and the next one
   differences = date_timedelta.diff().dt.days
   print(differences)
   ```

2. **Time Series Analysis**

   You can use Pandas ExtensionArrays to represent time series data. For example, you can create a DataFrame of daily sales data and then use methods to manipulate it:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Create a DataFrame with daily sales data
   sales_data = pd.DataFrame({
       'Date': pd.date_range('2022-01-01', periods=31),
       'Sales': [100, 120, 110, 130, 105, 125, 115, 135, 100, 110, 130, 105, 125, 115, 135, 100]
   })

   # Create a TimedeltaArray for the date range
   date_timedelta = pd.TimedeltaArray(sales_data['Date'])

   # Calculate the total sales for each day
   total_sales = sales_data['Sales'].cumsum()
   print(total_sales)
   print(date_timedelta)
   ```

Different choices for indexing
------------------------------

Object selection has had a number of user-requested additions in order to
support more explicit location based indexing. pandas now supports three types
of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*
  semantics).

    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.

Since many potential pandas users have some familiarity with
`SQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`_, this page is meant to provide some examples of how

Most of the examples will utilize the ``tips`` dataset found within pandas tests. We'll read
the data into a DataFrame called ``tips`` and assume we have a database table of the same name and

SELECT

In SQL, selection is done using a comma-separated list of columns you'd like to select (or a ``*``
to select all columns):

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT total_bill, tip, smoker, time
    FROM tips;

With pandas, column selection is done by passing a list of column names to your DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

    tips[[""total_bill"", ""tip"", ""smoker"", ""time""]]

Calling the DataFrame without the list of column names would display all columns (akin to SQL's
``*``). In SQL, you can add a calculated column:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT *, tip/total_bill as tip_rate
    FROM tips;

With pandas, you can use the :meth:`DataFrame.assign` method of a DataFrame to append a new column:

.. ipython:: python

    tips.assign(tip_rate=tips[""tip""] / tips[""total_bill""])

### What are Windowing Operations in Pandas?

Windowing operations are used in the context of data analysis with pandas to treat data as a sequence of events or a series of observations. These operations allow you to perform calculations and operations on a time series or a set of data points in a way that is meaningful for a specific window of time.

### Key Features of Windowing Operations in Pandas:

1. **Sliding Windows**: This is the most basic type of windowing. It involves calculating values for a specific range of data points. For example, you can calculate the average of values from the first 5 rows, the last 5 rows, or any other fixed window size.

2. **Reshaping Data**: Pandas can reshape data to better suit windowing operations. For instance, you can convert a wide format into long format, or vice versa, which can facilitate calculations.

3. **Periodic Operations**: Many windowing operations can be periodic, allowing you to apply the same operation at regular intervals (e.g., daily, monthly, weekly).

4. **Handling Missing Values**: Windowing operations can also be designed to handle missing values, allowing you to calculate averages or totals for missing data points.

### Example of Windowing Operations:

1. **Simple Average Window**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
   window_size = 2
   result = data.resample(window_size).mean()
   print(result)
   ```

2. **Sliding Average with Missing Values Handling**:
   ```python
   data = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], missing_value=0)
   window_size = 2
   result = data.resample(window_size).mean().fillna(0)
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Daily Averages**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.date_range('2022-01-01', periods=10)
   daily_avg = data.resample('D').mean()
   print(daily_avg)
   ```

### Conclusion:

Windowing operations in pandas are powerful tools for analyzing data, especially when dealing with time series data. They enable you to perform operations in a way that is meaningful for a specific window of time, which can significantly enhance your data analysis and visualization efforts. The flexibility offered by windowing operations, along with their ability to handle missing values, makes them a valuable component of any data analysis pipeline.","<s>[INST] What are windowing operations in the context of data analysis using pandas?

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: * Enables automatic and explicit data alignment. * Allows intuitive getting and setting of subsets of the data set. In this section, we will focus on the final point: namely, how to slice, dice,
and generally get and set subsets of pandas objects. The primary focus will be
on Series and DataFrame as they have received more development attention in
this area. .. note::

   The Python and NumPy indexing operators ``[]`` and attribute operator ``.``
   provide quick and easy access to pandas data structures across a wide range
   of use cases. This makes interactive work intuitive, as there's little new
   to learn if you already know how to deal with Python dictionaries and NumPy
   arrays. However, since the type of the data to be accessed isn't known in
   advance, directly using standard operators has some optimization limits. For
   production code, we recommended that you take advantage of the optimized
   pandas data access methods exposed in this chapter. See the :ref:`MultiIndex / Advanced Indexing <advanced>` for ``MultiIndex`` and more advanced indexing documentation. See the :ref:`cookbook<cookbook.selection>` for some advanced strategies. .. _indexing.choice:

Different choices for indexing
------------------------------

Object selection has had a number of user-requested additions in order to
support more explicit location based indexing. pandas now supports three types
of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*
  semantics).
Context 2: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.
Context 3: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It is built on top of the Numpy library and is designed to provide a more intuitive interface for working with structured data. 

### Installing Pandas

To install pandas, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

### Basic Operations

### Reading Data

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['John', 'Anna', 'Peter', 'Linda'],
        'Age': [28, 24, 35, 32]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

### Data Manipulation

```python
# Remove the first row
df = df.iloc[1:]

# Add a new column
df['Country'] = ['USA', 'UK', 'Germany', 'France']

# Group by 'Country' and calculate the mean of 'Age'
grouped = df.groupby('Country')['Age'].mean()
print(grouped)
```

### Data Plotting

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot a simple bar chart
plt.bar(df['Country'], df['Age'])
plt.xlabel('Country')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.title('Age Distribution by Country')
plt.show()
```

### Data Indexing

```python
# Access specific columns
print(df[['Name', 'Age']])

# Access specific rows
print(df.iloc[0:2]

# Access specific columns and rows
print(df[['Name', 'Age'].head())

# Access all columns except 'Name'
print(df.columns[1:])
```

### Data Reshaping

```python
# Reshape the data
df = df.pivot(index='Country', columns='Age', values='Name')
print(df)

# Reshape the data
df = df.melt(id_vars=['Country'], value_vars=['Age'], var_name='Age', value_name='Name')
print(df)

# Reshape the data
df = df.pivot(index='Country', columns='Age', values='Name')
```

### Data Grouping

```python
# Group by 'Country' and calculate the mean of 'Age'
grouped = df.groupby('Country')['Age'].mean()
print(grouped)

# Group by 'Country' and count the number of rows
count = df.groupby('Country').shape()
print(count)

# Group by 'Country' and count the number of unique values in 'Age'
unique_age = df.groupby('Country')['Age'].nunique()
print(unique_age)
```

### Data Sorting

```python
# Sort by 'Age'
df = df.sort_values(by='Age')

# Sort by 'Age' in descending order
df = df.sort_values(by='Age', ascending=False)

# Sort by 'Age' in ascending order
df = df.sort_values(by='Age', ascending=True)
```

### Data Filtering

```python
# Filter the data to include only rows where 'Age' is greater than 30
df = df[df['Age'] > 30]

# Filter the data to include only rows where 'Age' is less than 25
df = df[df['Age'] < 25]

# Filter the data to include only rows where 'Age' is between 25 and 35
df = df[(df['Age'] >= 25) & (df['Age'] <= 35)]
```

### Data Merging

```python
# Merge the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID')

# Merge the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='outer')

# Merge the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='left')

# Merge the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='right')
```

### Data Joining

```python
# Join the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID')

# Join the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='outer')

# Join the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='left')

# Join the data with another DataFrame
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='right')
```

### Data Concatenating

```python
# Concatenate the data
df1 = pd.DataFrame({'Name': ['John', 'Anna'], 'Age': [28, 24]})
df2 = pd.DataFrame({'Name': ['Peter', 'Linda'], 'Age': [35, 32]})
df = pd.concat([df1, df2])
```

### Data Splitting

```python
# Split the data into two lists
list1 = df['Name'].tolist()
list2 = df['Age'].tolist()
print(list1)
print(list2)

# Split the data into two DataFrames
df1 = df[['Name', 'Age']]
df2 = df[['Name', 'Age']]
df = pd.DataFrame(list1, index=df1.columns)
df = pd.DataFrame(list2, index=df2.columns)
```

### Data Exploratory Data Analysis

```python
# Plot a histogram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot a histogram
plt.hist(df['Age'], bins=10)
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Age Distribution')
plt.show()

# Plot a bar chart
plt.bar(df['Name'], df['Age'])
plt.xlabel('Name')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.title('Age Distribution by Name')
plt.show()
```

### Data Summary Statistics

```python
# Calculate the mean of 'Age'
mean_age = df['Age'].mean()
print(mean_age)

# Calculate the median of 'Age'
median_age = df['Age'].median()
print(median_age)

# Calculate the mode of 'Age'
mode_age = df['Age'].mode()
print(mode_age)

# Calculate the standard deviation of 'Age'
std_age = df['Age'].std()
print(std_age)
```

### Data Correlation

```python
# Correlation between 'Age' and 'Name'
correlation = df['Age'].corr(df['Name'])
print(correlation)

# Correlation between 'Age' and 'Age'
correlation = df['Age'].corr(df['Age'])
print(correlation)

# Correlation between 'Age' and 'Age'
correlation = df['Age'].corr(df['Age'])
print(correlation)
```

### Data Visualization

```python
# Plot a scatter plot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot a scatter plot
plt.scatter(df['Name'], df['Age'])
plt.xlabel('Name')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.title('Scatter Plot of Age vs Name')
plt.show()

# Plot a bar chart
plt.bar(df['Name'], df['Age'])
plt.xlabel('Name')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.title('Bar Chart of Age vs Name')
plt.show()
```

### Data Summary

```python
# Summarize the data
print(df.describe())

# Summarize the data
print(df.info())

# Summarize the data
print(df.head())

# Summarize the data
print","<s>[INST] What are windowing operations in the context of data analysis using pandas?
I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: * Enables automatic and explicit data alignment. * Allows intuitive getting and setting of subsets of the data set. In this section, we will focus on the final point: namely, how to slice, dice,
and generally get and set subsets of pandas objects. The primary focus will be
on Series and DataFrame as they have received more development attention in
this area. .. note::

   The Python and NumPy indexing operators ``[]`` and attribute operator ``.``
   provide quick and easy access to pandas data structures across a wide range
   of use cases. This makes interactive work intuitive, as there's little new
   to learn if you already know how to deal with Python dictionaries and NumPy
   arrays. However, since the type of the data to be accessed isn't known in
   advance, directly using standard operators has some optimization limits. For
   production code, we recommended that you take advantage of the optimized
   pandas data access methods exposed in this chapter. See the :ref:`MultiIndex / Advanced Indexing <advanced>` for ``MultiIndex`` and more advanced indexing documentation. See the :ref:`cookbook<cookbook.selection>` for some advanced strategies. .. _indexing.choice:

Different choices for indexing
------------------------------

Object selection has had a number of user-requested additions in order to
support more explicit location based indexing. pandas now supports three types
of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*
  semantics).
Context 2: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.
Context 3: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

Context 4: .. _scale:

*************************
Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.
Context 5: .. _compare_with_sql:

{{ header }}

Comparison with SQL
********************
Since many potential pandas users have some familiarity with
`SQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`_, this page is meant to provide some examples of how
various SQL operations would be performed using pandas. .. include:: includes/introduction.rst

Most of the examples will utilize the ``tips`` dataset found within pandas tests. We'll read
the data into a DataFrame called ``tips`` and assume we have a database table of the same name and
structure. .. ipython:: python

    url = (
        ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev""
        ""/pandas/main/pandas/tests/io/data/csv/tips.csv""
    )
    tips = pd.read_csv(url)
    tips


Copies vs. in place operations
------------------------------

.. include:: includes/copies.rst


SELECT
------
In SQL, selection is done using a comma-separated list of columns you'd like to select (or a ``*``
to select all columns):

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT total_bill, tip, smoker, time
    FROM tips;

With pandas, column selection is done by passing a list of column names to your DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

    tips[[""total_bill"", ""tip"", ""smoker"", ""time""]]

Calling the DataFrame without the list of column names would display all columns (akin to SQL's
``*``). In SQL, you can add a calculated column:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT *, tip/total_bill as tip_rate
    FROM tips;

With pandas, you can use the :meth:`DataFrame.assign` method of a DataFrame to append a new column:

.. ipython:: python

    tips.assign(tip_rate=tips[""tip""] / tips[""total_bill""])

WHERE
-----
Filtering in SQL is done via a WHERE clause. ..

### Windowing Operations in Pandas
Windowing operations allow you to perform calculations over a sliding window of data, which can be useful in data analysis when you need to explore trends or patterns over time. Pandas provides several windowing functions that can be applied to various types of data.

### Key Windowing Functions
1. **`window()`**: Returns a new DataFrame with a window of specified size, containing the sliced data. You can specify the start and end indices of the window.
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
   window_size = 2
   windowed_data = pd.DataFrame(windowed_data).window(window_size)
   ```

2. **`groupby()`**: Groups the data by one or more columns and applies a function over each group. You can use windowing to analyze data over time.
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'B': [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]}
   grouped_data = pd.DataFrame(data).groupby('A')['B'].mean()
   ```

3. **`rolling()`**: Returns a new DataFrame with a rolling window of specified size, containing the sliced data. You can specify the start and end indices of the window.
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
   rolling_window_size = 2
   rolling_data = pd.DataFrame(data).rolling(window_size).mean()
   ```

4. **`resample()`**: Resamples the data using a specified aggregation function. You can use windowing to transform data over time.
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
   resampled_data = pd.DataFrame(data).resample('2').mean()
   ```

### Conclusion
Windowing operations in Pandas are powerful tools for analyzing data over time, allowing you to explore trends, patterns, and relationships in your data. By using these functions, you can transform your data, group it, and perform calculations over a sliding window, providing a more comprehensive understanding of your data.

### Example Use Cases
- Analyzing stock prices over time to predict future trends.
- Evaluating sales data over a month to identify seasonal patterns.
- Exploring website traffic over time to understand user behavior.

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: * Enables automatic and explicit data alignment. * Allows intuitive getting and setting of subsets of the data set. In this section, we will focus on the final point: namely, how to slice, dice,
and generally get and set subsets of pandas objects. The primary focus will be
on Series and DataFrame as they have received more development attention in
this area. .. note::

   The Python and NumPy indexing operators ``[]`` and attribute operator ``.``
   provide quick and easy access to pandas data structures across a wide range
   of use cases. This makes interactive work intuitive, as there's little new
   to learn if you already know how to deal with Python dictionaries and NumPy
   arrays. However, since the type of the data to be accessed isn't known in
   advance, directly using standard operators has some optimization limits. For
   production code, we recommended that you take advantage of the optimized
   pandas data access methods exposed in this chapter. See the :ref:`MultiIndex / Advanced Indexing <advanced>` for ``MultiIndex`` and more advanced indexing documentation. See the :ref:`cookbook<cookbook.selection>` for some advanced strategies. .. _indexing.choice:

Different choices for indexing
------------------------------

Object selection has had a number of user-requested additions in order to
support more explicit location based indexing. pandas now supports three types
of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*
  semantics).
Context 2: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.
Context 3: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

Context 4: .. _scale:

*************************
Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.
Context 5: .. _compare_with_sql:

{{ header }}

Comparison with SQL
********************
Since many potential pandas users have some familiarity with
`SQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`_, this page is meant to provide some examples of how
various SQL operations would be performed using pandas. .. include:: includes/introduction.rst

Most of the examples will utilize the ``tips`` dataset found within pandas tests. We'll read
the data into a DataFrame called ``tips`` and assume we have a database table of the same name and
structure. .. ipython:: python

    url = (
        ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev""
        ""/pandas/main/pandas/tests/io/data/csv/tips.csv""
    )
    tips = pd.read_csv(url)
    tips


Copies vs. in place operations
------------------------------

.. include:: includes/copies.rst


SELECT
------
In SQL, selection is done using a comma-separated list of columns you'd like to select (or a ``*``
to select all columns):

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT total_bill, tip, smoker, time
    FROM tips;

With pandas, column selection is done by passing a list of column names to your DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

    tips[[""total_bill"", ""tip"", ""smoker"", ""time""]]

Calling the DataFrame without the list of column names would display all columns (akin to SQL's
``*``). In SQL, you can add a calculated column:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT *, tip/total_bill as tip_rate
    FROM tips;

With pandas, you can use the :meth:`DataFrame.assign` method of a DataFrame to append a new column:

.. ipython:: python

    tips.assign(tip_rate=tips[""tip""] / tips[""total_bill""])

WHERE
-----
Filtering in SQL is done via a WHERE clause. ..

Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)


.. _window.overview:

Overview
--------

pandas supports 4 types of windowing operations:

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

Context 3: With custom types and inference this is not always possible so exceptions are made, but every effort should be exhausted to avoid ``cast`` before going down such paths. pandas-specific types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commonly used types specific to pandas will appear in `pandas._typing <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/_typing.py>`_ and you should use these where applicable. This module is private for now but ultimately this should be exposed to third party libraries who want to implement type checking against pandas. For example, quite a few functions in pandas accept a ``dtype`` argument. This can be expressed as a string like ``""object""``, a ``numpy.dtype`` like ``np.int64`` or even a pandas ``ExtensionDtype`` like ``pd.CategoricalDtype``. Rather than burden the user with having to constantly annotate all of those options, this can simply be imported and reused from the pandas._typing module

.. code-block:: python

   from pandas._typing import Dtype

   def as_type(dtype: Dtype) -> ...:
       ... This module will ultimately house types for repeatedly used concepts like ""path-like"", ""array-like"", ""numeric"", etc... and can also hold aliases for commonly appearing parameters like ``axis``. Development of this module is active so be sure to refer to the source for the most up to date list of available types. Validating type hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pandas uses `mypy <http://mypy-lang.org>`_ and `pyright <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright>`_ to statically analyze the code base and type hints. After making any change you can ensure your type hints are consistent by running

.. code-block:: shell

    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files mypy
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright_reportGeneralTypeIssues
    # the following might fail if the installed pandas version does not correspond to your local git version
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files stubtest

in your python environment. .. warning::

    * Please be aware that the above commands will use the current python environment. If your python packages are older/newer than those installed by the pandas CI, the above commands might fail. This is often the case when the ``mypy`` or ``numpy`` versions do not match. Please see :ref:`how to setup the python environment <contributing.conda>` or select a `recently succeeded workflow <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/actions/workflows/code-checks.yml?query=branch%3Amain+is%3Asuccess>`_, select the ""Docstring validation, typing, and other manual pre-commit hooks"" job, then click on ""Set up Conda"" and ""Environment info"" to see which versions the pandas CI installs. .. _contributing.ci:

Testing type hints in code using pandas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

    * pandas is not yet a py.typed library (:pep:`561`)! The primary purpose of locally declaring pandas as a py.typed library is to test and
      improve the pandas-builtin type annotations. Until pandas becomes a py.typed library, it is possible to easily experiment with the type
annotations shipped with pandas by creating an empty file named ""py.typed"" in the pandas
installation folder:

.. code-block:: none

   python -c ""import pandas; import pathlib; (pathlib.Path(pandas.__path__[0]) / 'py.typed').touch()""

The existence of the py.typed file signals to type checkers that pandas is already a py.typed
library. This makes type checkers aware of the type annotations shipped with pandas. Testing with continuous integration
-----------------------------------

The pandas test suite will run automatically on `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/features/actions/>`__
continuous integration services, once your pull request is submitted. However, if you wish to run the test suite on a branch prior to submitting the pull request,
then the continuous integration services need to be hooked to your GitHub repository. Instructions are here
for `GitHub Actions <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/>`__. A pull-request will be considered for merging when you have an all 'green' build. If any tests are failing,
then you will get a red 'X', where you can click through to see the individual failed tests. This is an example of a green build.

********************
Since many potential pandas users have some familiarity with
`SQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`_, this page is meant to provide some examples of how
various SQL operations would be performed using pandas. .. include:: includes/introduction.rst

Most of the examples will utilize the ``tips`` dataset found within pandas tests. We'll read
the data into a DataFrame called ``tips`` and assume we have a database table of the same name and
structure. .. ipython:: python

Copies vs. in place operations
------------------------------

SELECT
------
In SQL, selection is done using a comma-separated list of columns you'd like to select (or a ``*``
to select all columns):

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT total_bill, tip, smoker, time
    FROM tips;

With pandas, column selection is done by passing a list of column names to your DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

    tips[[""total_bill"", ""tip"", ""smoker"", ""time""]]

Calling the DataFrame without the list of column names would display all columns (akin to SQL's
``*``). In SQL, you can add a calculated column:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT *, tip/total_bill as tip_rate
    FROM tips;

With pandas, you can use the :meth:`DataFrame.assign` method of a DataFrame to append a new column:

.. ipython:: python

    tips.assign(tip_rate=tips[""tip""] / tips[""total_bill""])

WHERE

","<s>[INST] Can you explain the different types of windowing operations supported by pandas?
 [/INST] <s>[INST] How do you use the `window` function in pandas to create windowed data? </INST>

## Step 1: Understanding the Question
The question asks for an explanation of the different types of windowing operations supported by pandas and how to use the `window` function to create windowed data.

## Step 2: Types of Windowing Operations
Pandas supports several types of windowing operations:
1. **Fixed Window**: The size of the window is fixed and known.
2. **Sliding Window**: The window moves over the data, and you specify the start and end points of the window.
3. **Reshaped Window**: The window can be reshaped to fit the data, allowing for different types of operations.
4. **Time Windows**: This includes operations that operate on time series data.

## Step 3: Using the `window` Function
The `window` function in pandas allows you to create a windowed dataset. For example, you can specify the start and end points of the window to create a sliding window or use the `shift` function to shift the data along a time axis.

## Step 4: Example Usage
An example of using the `window` function could be to create a DataFrame with a column of time values and then use the `window` function to create a new column that represents the value at the end of the current window.

The final answer is: 
There is no specific numerical answer to this question as it requires an explanation of different types of windowing operations and how to use the `window` function in pandas.","<s>[INST] Can you explain the different types of windowing operations supported by pandas?
 [/INST] 

The different types of windowing operations supported by pandas include:

*   **Rolling Window**: This allows you to compute the average, sum, or count of values over a specified number of consecutive observations. You can specify the window size using the `window` parameter.
*   **Expanding Window**: This allows you to compute the average, sum, or count of values over a specified number of consecutive observations, but you can also include the most recent values from the end of the window. This is useful for aggregating data over time.
*   **Lag**: This allows you to compute the value of a variable at a specific point in time, relative to another value. You can specify the lag and the period over which to compute the value.
*   **Groupby Window**: This allows you to apply a window operation to a grouped data structure, such as a DataFrame with multiple columns. You can specify the group by column and the window size.
*   **Resample Window**: This allows you to transform data from one time frame to another, effectively aggregating the data using a specified window. You can specify the period over which to resample the data.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of some of these operations:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-02', '2022-01-03', '2022-01-04', '2022-01-05'],
    'Value': [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Rolling window
window = 3
result = df['Value'].rolling(window).mean()
print(""Rolling window average:"", result)

# Expanding window
result_expanded = df['Value'].expanding().mean()
print(""Expanding window average:"", result_expanded)

# Lag
result_lag = df['Value'].shift(1)
print(""Lag value:"", result_lag)

# Groupby window
group_by_date = df.groupby('Date')['Value'].mean()
print(""Group by date mean:"", group_by_date)

# Resample window
result_resampled = df.resample('M').mean()
print(""Resampled monthly mean:"", result_resampled)
```

********************
Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)


.. _window.overview:

Overview
--------

pandas supports 4 types of windowing operations:

#. Rolling window: Generic fixed or variable sliding window over the values. #. Weighted window: Weighted, non-rectangular window supplied by the ``scipy.signal`` library. #. Expanding window: Accumulating window over the values. #.
Context 2: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the

I will also provide some contexts, use it only when it is helpful(contexts can be not relavant at all). Answer within 400 words.
Context 1: .. _window:

{{ header }}

********************
Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)


.. _window.overview:

Overview
--------

pandas supports 4 types of windowing operations:

#. Rolling window: Generic fixed or variable sliding window over the values. #. Weighted window: Weighted, non-rectangular window supplied by the ``scipy.signal`` library. #. Expanding window: Accumulating window over the values. #.
Context 2: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support
---------------

The first stop for pandas issues and ideas is the `GitHub Issue Tracker
<https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues>`__. If you have a general question,
pandas community experts can answer through `Stack Overflow
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas>`__. Community
---------

pandas is actively supported today by a community of like-minded individuals around
the world who contribute their valuable time and energy to help make open source
pandas possible. Thanks to `all of our contributors <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/graphs/contributors>`__. If you're interested in contributing, please visit the :ref:`contributing guide <contributing>`. pandas is a `NumFOCUS <https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects>`__ sponsored project. This will help ensure the success of the development of pandas as a world-class open-source
project and makes it possible to `donate <https://pandas.pydata.org/donate.html>`__ to the project. Project governance
------------------

The governance process that pandas project has used informally since its inception in 2008 is formalized in `Project Governance documents <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/web/pandas/about/governance.md>`__. The documents clarify how decisions are made and how the various elements of our community interact, including the relationship between open source collaborative development and work that may be funded by for-profit or non-profit entities.

Context 3: With custom types and inference this is not always possible so exceptions are made, but every effort should be exhausted to avoid ``cast`` before going down such paths. pandas-specific types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commonly used types specific to pandas will appear in `pandas._typing <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/_typing.py>`_ and you should use these where applicable. This module is private for now but ultimately this should be exposed to third party libraries who want to implement type checking against pandas. For example, quite a few functions in pandas accept a ``dtype`` argument. This can be expressed as a string like ``""object""``, a ``numpy.dtype`` like ``np.int64`` or even a pandas ``ExtensionDtype`` like ``pd.CategoricalDtype``. Rather than burden the user with having to constantly annotate all of those options, this can simply be imported and reused from the pandas._typing module

.. code-block:: python

   from pandas._typing import Dtype

   def as_type(dtype: Dtype) -> ...:
       ... This module will ultimately house types for repeatedly used concepts like ""path-like"", ""array-like"", ""numeric"", etc... and can also hold aliases for commonly appearing parameters like ``axis``. Development of this module is active so be sure to refer to the source for the most up to date list of available types. Validating type hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pandas uses `mypy <http://mypy-lang.org>`_ and `pyright <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright>`_ to statically analyze the code base and type hints. After making any change you can ensure your type hints are consistent by running

.. code-block:: shell

    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files mypy
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright_reportGeneralTypeIssues
    # the following might fail if the installed pandas version does not correspond to your local git version
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files stubtest

in your python environment. .. warning::

    * Please be aware that the above commands will use the current python environment. If your python packages are older/newer than those installed by the pandas CI, the above commands might fail. This is often the case when the ``mypy`` or ``numpy`` versions do not match. Please see :ref:`how to setup the python environment <contributing.conda>` or select a `recently succeeded workflow <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/actions/workflows/code-checks.yml?query=branch%3Amain+is%3Asuccess>`_, select the ""Docstring validation, typing, and other manual pre-commit hooks"" job, then click on ""Set up Conda"" and ""Environment info"" to see which versions the pandas CI installs. .. _contributing.ci:

Testing type hints in code using pandas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

    * pandas is not yet a py.typed library (:pep:`561`)! The primary purpose of locally declaring pandas as a py.typed library is to test and
      improve the pandas-builtin type annotations. Until pandas becomes a py.typed library, it is possible to easily experiment with the type
annotations shipped with pandas by creating an empty file named ""py.typed"" in the pandas
installation folder:

.. code-block:: none

   python -c ""import pandas; import pathlib; (pathlib.Path(pandas.__path__[0]) / 'py.typed').touch()""

The existence of the py.typed file signals to type checkers that pandas is already a py.typed
library. This makes type checkers aware of the type annotations shipped with pandas. Testing with continuous integration
-----------------------------------

The pandas test suite will run automatically on `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/features/actions/>`__
continuous integration services, once your pull request is submitted. However, if you wish to run the test suite on a branch prior to submitting the pull request,
then the continuous integration services need to be hooked to your GitHub repository. Instructions are here
for `GitHub Actions <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/>`__. A pull-request will be considered for merging when you have an all 'green' build. If any tests are failing,
then you will get a red 'X', where you can click through to see the individual failed tests. This is an example of a green build.
Context 4: .. _compare_with_sql:

{{ header }}

Comparison with SQL
********************
Since many potential pandas users have some familiarity with
`SQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`_, this page is meant to provide some examples of how
various SQL operations would be performed using pandas. .. include:: includes/introduction.rst

Most of the examples will utilize the ``tips`` dataset found within pandas tests. We'll read
the data into a DataFrame called ``tips`` and assume we have a database table of the same name and
structure. .. ipython:: python

    url = (
        ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev""
        ""/pandas/main/pandas/tests/io/data/csv/tips.csv""
    )
    tips = pd.read_csv(url)
    tips


Copies vs. in place operations
------------------------------

.. include:: includes/copies.rst


SELECT
------
In SQL, selection is done using a comma-separated list of columns you'd like to select (or a ``*``
to select all columns):

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT total_bill, tip, smoker, time
    FROM tips;

With pandas, column selection is done by passing a list of column names to your DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

    tips[[""total_bill"", ""tip"", ""smoker"", ""time""]]

Calling the DataFrame without the list of column names would display all columns (akin to SQL's
``*``). In SQL, you can add a calculated column:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT *, tip/total_bill as tip_rate
    FROM tips;

With pandas, you can use the :meth:`DataFrame.assign` method of a DataFrame to append a new column:

.. ipython:: python

    tips.assign(tip_rate=tips[""tip""] / tips[""total_bill""])

WHERE
-----
Filtering in SQL is done via a WHERE clause. ..
Context 5: note::
    This is just a starting point. Similar to spreadsheet
    software, pandas represents data as a table with columns and rows. Apart
    from the representation, the data manipulations and calculations
    you would do in spreadsheet software are also supported by pandas. Continue

The answer is:

Pandas provides several types of windowing operations that allow you to perform calculations over a contiguous range of rows or columns. Some common types of windowing operations include:

* `Window` (or `window`: a tuple specifying the start and end of the window)
* `GroupBy` (or `groupby`: a grouping operation that returns a window of groups)
* `Roll` (or `roll`: a rolling operation that returns a window of values)
* `Resample` (or `resample`: a resampling operation that returns a window of values)
* `Period` (or `period`: a periodic operation that returns a window of values)
* `Binned` (or `bin`: a binned operation that returns a window of grouped values)

Each of these types allows you to define the size and the overlap of the window, which can be adjusted to suit your specific needs.","{'overall_score': 6, 'overall_rationale': 'The answer provides a list of windowing operations supported by pandas, but there is room for improvement in terms of explanation and accuracy.

********************
Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)


.. _window.overview:

Overview
--------

pandas supports 4 types of windowing operations:

#. Rolling window: Generic fixed or variable sliding window over the values. #. Weighted window: Weighted, non-rectangular window supplied by the ``scipy.signal`` library. #. Expanding window: Accumulating window over the values. #.
Context 2: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

<https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues>`__. If you have a general question,
pandas community experts can answer through `Stack Overflow
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas>`__. Community
---------

pandas is actively supported today by a community of like-minded individuals around
the world who contribute their valuable time and energy to help make open source
pandas possible. Thanks to `all of our contributors <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/graphs/contributors>`__. If you're interested in contributing, please visit the :ref:`contributing guide <contributing>`. pandas is a `NumFOCUS <https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects>`__ sponsored project. This will help ensure the success of the development of pandas as a world-class open-source
project and makes it possible to `donate <https://pandas.pydata.org/donate.html>`__ to the project. Project governance

Context 3: With custom types and inference this is not always possible so exceptions are made, but every effort should be exhausted to avoid ``cast`` before going down such paths. pandas-specific types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commonly used types specific to pandas will appear in `pandas._typing <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/_typing.py>`_ and you should use these where applicable. This module is private for now but ultimately this should be exposed to third party libraries who want to implement type checking against pandas. For example, quite a few functions in pandas accept a ``dtype`` argument. This can be expressed as a string like ``""object""``, a ``numpy.dtype`` like ``np.int64`` or even a pandas ``ExtensionDtype`` like ``pd.CategoricalDtype``. Rather than burden the user with having to constantly annotate all of those options, this can simply be imported and reused from the pandas._typing module

.. code-block:: python

   from pandas._typing import Dtype

   def as_type(dtype: Dtype) -> ...:
       ... This module will ultimately house types for repeatedly used concepts like ""path-like"", ""array-like"", ""numeric"", etc... and can also hold aliases for commonly appearing parameters like ``axis``. Development of this module is active so be sure to refer to the source for the most up to date list of available types. Validating type hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pandas uses `mypy <http://mypy-lang.org>`_ and `pyright <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright>`_ to statically analyze the code base and type hints. After making any change you can ensure your type hints are consistent by running

.. code-block:: shell

    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files mypy
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files pyright_reportGeneralTypeIssues
    # the following might fail if the installed pandas version does not correspond to your local git version
    pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files stubtest

in your python environment. .. warning::

    * Please be aware that the above commands will use the current python environment. If your python packages are older/newer than those installed by the pandas CI, the above commands might fail. This is often the case when the ``mypy`` or ``numpy`` versions do not match. Please see :ref:`how to setup the python environment <contributing.conda>` or select a `recently succeeded workflow <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/actions/workflows/code-checks.yml?query=branch%3Amain+is%3Asuccess>`_, select the ""Docstring validation, typing, and other manual pre-commit hooks"" job, then click on ""Set up Conda"" and ""Environment info"" to see which versions the pandas CI installs. .. _contributing.ci:

Testing type hints in code using pandas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

    * pandas is not yet a py.typed library (:pep:`561`)! The primary purpose of locally declaring pandas as a py.typed library is to test and
      improve the pandas-builtin type annotations. Until pandas becomes a py.typed library, it is possible to easily experiment with the type
annotations shipped with pandas by creating an empty file named ""py.typed"" in the pandas
installation folder:

.. code-block:: none

   python -c ""import pandas; import pathlib; (pathlib.Path(pandas.__path__[0]) / 'py.typed').touch()""

The existence of the py.typed file signals to type checkers that pandas is already a py.typed
library. This makes type checkers aware of the type annotations shipped with pandas. Testing with continuous integration
-----------------------------------

The pandas test suite will run automatically on `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/features/actions/>`__
continuous integration services, once your pull request is submitted. However, if you wish to run the test suite on a branch prior to submitting the pull request,
then the continuous integration services need to be hooked to your GitHub repository. Instructions are here
for `GitHub Actions <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/>`__. A pull-request will be considered for merging when you have an all 'green' build. If any tests are failing,
then you will get a red 'X', where you can click through to see the individual failed tests. This is an example of a green build.
Context 4: .. _compare_with_sql:

Comparison with SQL
********************
Since many potential pandas users have some familiarity with
`SQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`_, this page is meant to provide some examples of how
various SQL operations would be performed using pandas. .. include:: includes/introduction.rst

Most of the examples will utilize the ``tips`` dataset found within pandas tests. We'll read
the data into a DataFrame called ``tips`` and assume we have a database table of the same name and
structure. .. ipython:: python

    url = (
        ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev""
        ""/pandas/main/pandas/tests/io/data/csv/tips.csv""
    )
    tips = pd.read_csv(url)
    tips


Copies vs. in place operations
------------------------------

.. include:: includes/copies.rst


SELECT
------
In SQL, selection is done using a comma-separated list of columns you'd like to select (or a ``*``
to select all columns):

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT total_bill, tip, smoker, time
    FROM tips;

With pandas, column selection is done by passing a list of column names to your DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

    tips[[""total_bill"", ""tip"", ""smoker"", ""time""]]

Calling the DataFrame without the list of column names would display all columns (akin to SQL's
``*``). In SQL, you can add a calculated column:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT *, tip/total_bill as tip_rate
    FROM tips;

With pandas, you can use the :meth:`DataFrame.assign` method of a DataFrame to append a new column:

.. ipython:: python

    tips.assign(tip_rate=tips[""tip""] / tips[""total_bill""])

WHERE
-----
Filtering in SQL is done via a WHERE clause. ..
Context 5: note::
    This is just a starting point. Similar to spreadsheet
    software, pandas represents data as a table with columns and rows. Apart
    from the representation, the data manipulations and calculations
    you would do in spreadsheet software are also supported by pandas. Continue

Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)


.. _window.overview:

Overview
--------

pandas supports 4 types of windowing operations:

#. Rolling window: Generic fixed or variable sliding window over the values. #. Weighted window: Weighted, non-rectangular window supplied by the ``scipy.signal`` library. #. Expanding window: Accumulating window over the values. #.
","<s>[INST] How does the rolling window function in pandas work, and what is an example of its use?
 [/INST] 

The rolling window function in pandas is used to create a new Series or DataFrame that represents the values from a given window of data. The window size determines how many consecutive values are included in the calculation. The window can be specified by an integer argument, and it can be applied to existing Series or DataFrames. The window can be of any shape, including 1D, 2D, or 3D, which allows for a variety of aggregation functions to be applied.

### Example of Using the Rolling Window Function

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the usage of the rolling window function.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Value': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create a rolling window of 3
window = 3

# Create a new Series with the rolling window function
rolling_window = df['Value'].rolling(window)

# Display the original Series and the rolled values
print(""Original Series:"")
print(df)

# Display the rolled values
print(""\nRolled Values:"")
print(rolling_window)

# Calculate the mean of the rolled values
mean_rolling = rolling_window.rolling(window).mean()
print(""\nMean of Rolled Values:"")
print(mean_rolling)
```

### Explanation of Output:

1. **Original Series:** The original DataFrame `df` is displayed.
2. **Rolled Values:** The values from the 'Value' column of `df` are displayed after applying the rolling window of size 3. This demonstrates how the rolling window function aggregates the values over time.
3. **Mean of Rolled Values:** The mean of the rolled values is calculated and displayed, showing how the rolling window aggregates the data.

### Conclusion

The rolling window function in pandas allows for dynamic aggregation of data over time, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and manipulation. This function can be applied to various datasets and can be customized based on the window size and aggregation function used.","<s>[INST] How does the rolling window function in pandas work, and what is an example of its use?
 [/INST] 

The rolling window function in pandas is a powerful feature that allows you to apply a function to a series or a DataFrame over a sliding window. This can be particularly useful for data analysis where you need to calculate statistics over time, such as the moving average, moving sum, or moving median.

### Understanding the Rolling Window Function

The rolling window function operates on a time series data by sliding a window of values over the series. You can specify the size of the window using the `window` parameter, which can be an integer or a list of integers. The function can then apply a specified function to each value in the window, resulting in a new series with the calculated values.

### Example of Use:

Let's consider a simple example with a series of temperatures over a month:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
temperatures = pd.Series([23, 25, 28, 27, 25, 30, 32, 35, 30, 28])

# Define the rolling window size
window = 3

# Apply the rolling mean function
result = temperatures.rolling(window).mean()

print(result)
```

In this example:
- We create a pandas Series with temperatures for each day of a month.
- We define the rolling window size as 3 days.
- We apply the `rolling` function with the specified window size to the `temperatures` Series. This operation will calculate the mean of the temperatures over each 3-day window.

### Output:

The output of the `result` will be the average temperature for each of those 3-day periods, resulting in a new Series with the daily averages.

### Conclusion:

The rolling window function in pandas is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis, allowing you to apply various functions over time series data, making it a versatile and useful feature in data analysis and programming.","{'overall_score': 7, 'overall_rationale': 'The answer provides a general overview of the rolling window function in pandas and includes an example to illustrate its use. However, there are inaccuracies and missing details in the explanation and implementation presented, which affect the evaluation scores.', 'grammar_score': 8, 'grammar_rationale': 'The grammatical structure of the response is largely sound.

However, the mention of using a ""list of integers"" for the window parameter could confuse readers as pandas currently accepts only integer values for fixed window sizes.', 'relevance_score': 8, 'relevance_rationale': 'The explanation is highly relevant to the question, covering the functionality and application of the rolling window in pandas.

Context 3: * Enables automatic and explicit data alignment. * Allows intuitive getting and setting of subsets of the data set. In this section, we will focus on the final point: namely, how to slice, dice,
and generally get and set subsets of pandas objects. The primary focus will be
on Series and DataFrame as they have received more development attention in
this area. .. note::

   The Python and NumPy indexing operators ``[]`` and attribute operator ``.``
   provide quick and easy access to pandas data structures across a wide range
   of use cases. This makes interactive work intuitive, as there's little new
   to learn if you already know how to deal with Python dictionaries and NumPy
   arrays. However, since the type of the data to be accessed isn't known in
   advance, directly using standard operators has some optimization limits. For
   production code, we recommended that you take advantage of the optimized
   pandas data access methods exposed in this chapter. See the :ref:`MultiIndex / Advanced Indexing <advanced>` for ``MultiIndex`` and more advanced indexing documentation. See the :ref:`cookbook<cookbook.selection>` for some advanced strategies. .. _indexing.choice:

Different choices for indexing
------------------------------

Object selection has had a number of user-requested additions in order to
support more explicit location based indexing. pandas now supports three types
of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*
  semantics).
Context 4: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.
Context 5: .. _window:

********************
Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)


.. _window.overview:

Overview
--------

pandas supports 4 types of windowing operations:

#. Rolling window: Generic fixed or variable sliding window over the values. #. Weighted window: Weighted, non-rectangular window supplied by the ``scipy.signal`` library. #. Expanding window: Accumulating window over the values. #.

This detracts from the readability and clarity of the answer. The markdown syntax isn't correctly rendered, affecting grammar and presentation."", 'logic_score': 8, 'logic_rationale': ""The functional logic explaining what a rolling window is and how it works within pandas makes sense. Mentioning that it's similar to a groupby operation adds logical clarity.

Yet, the presence of unrelated contextual text dampens the relevance since not all content is directly related to answering the question about rolling windows.""}","{'overall_score': 7.0, 'overall_rationale': 'The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the rolling window function in pandas, discussing its operation and providing a code example for better understanding. However, certain improvements can be made in terms of clarity and conciseness, along with better alignment of the rationale with the evaluation scores.', 'grammar_score': 8.0, 'grammar_rationale': 'The answer is generally free from grammatical errors.

However, there is an opportunity to improve the logical transition between explanation and example for easier understanding.', 'relevance_score': 6.0, 'relevance_rationale': 'While the answer stays within the relevant context of explaining a rolling window in pandas, it leaves a bit more information than necessary, possibly due to the influence of the context provided. The example could be elaborated more on its practical applications instead of focusing solely on the API and function details.'}","<s>[INST] How does the rolling window function in pandas work, and what is an example of its use?
 [/INST] 

The rolling window function in pandas is used to compute moving averages, which are the average values of a dataset over a specified window size. The window size can be specified using the `window` parameter, and the function returns a new Series or DataFrame with the average values over the specified window.

### Example of Use:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Values': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Rolling window of 3
window = 3
result = df.rolling(window).mean()
print(result)
```

Output:
```
0    2.5
1    3.0
2    3.5
3    4.0
4    4.5
```

In this example, the `rolling` function is used to create a new Series with the average values of the `Values` column over a window size of 3. The result is a new Series where each value is the average of the values within the corresponding window.","{'overall_score': 8, 'overall_rationale': ""The answer provides a correct and concise explanation of how the rolling window function in pandas is used. It includes an accurate code snippet that demonstrates its functionality, which is beneficial for the reader's understanding. However, some minor improvements could be made regarding clarity in defining what a rolling window is and correcting a slight error in describing the output, which might add confusion for a new learner."", 'grammar_score': 9, 'grammar_rationale': ""The grammar used is generally correct, with well-structured sentences. Minor improvements could enhance clarity, such as specifying how rolling computation works over different uses (sums, max, etc.), besides mean, to capture a broad audience's potential queries."", 'logic_score': 8, 'logic_rationale': 'The explanation outlines a logical progression from describing the concept to providing an example. However, logic falters slightly by not clearly explaining that the mean of the first window is computed only when there are enough values to meet the window size, typically leading to NaNs if fewer elements are available.', 'relevance_score': 9, 'relevance_rationale': 'The content is highly relevant, effectively focusing on the core function of `rolling`, how it works, and providing a usable, clear example. Relevance could be further enhanced by briefly discussing other possible applications of the `rolling` function beyond the mean, which would provide a broader understanding to the reader.'}","<s>[INST] How does the rolling window function in pandas work, and what is an example of its use?

Different choices for indexing
------------------------------

Object selection has had a number of user-requested additions in order to
support more explicit location based indexing. pandas now supports three types
of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*
  semantics).
Context 4: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.

********************
Windowing operations
********************

pandas contains a compact set of APIs for performing windowing operations - an operation that performs
an aggregation over a sliding partition of values. The API functions similarly to the ``groupby`` API
in that :class:`Series` and :class:`DataFrame` call the windowing method with
necessary parameters and then subsequently call the aggregation function. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(range(5))
   s.rolling(window=2).sum()

The windows are comprised by looking back the length of the window from the current observation. The result above can be derived by taking the sum of the following windowed partitions of data:

.. ipython:: python

   for window in s.rolling(window=2):
       print(window)


.. _window.overview:

Overview
--------

pandas supports 4 types of windowing operations:

#. Rolling window: Generic fixed or variable sliding window over the values. #. Weighted window: Weighted, non-rectangular window supplied by the ``scipy.signal`` library. #. Expanding window: Accumulating window over the values. #.

Answer within 400 words. 

- The rolling window function in pandas allows you to perform an aggregation over a sliding partition of data. This function can be used to perform various types of windowing operations, including the rolling sum, the rolling mean, and the rolling median.
- The rolling window function is particularly useful when you need to calculate the average or the sum of a set of values over a certain period.
- The function is implemented using the `.rolling()` method, which can be used on either a `DataFrame` or a `Series`.
- The window can be fixed or variable, depending on the desired length of the window.
- The window can be weighted, which allows you to specify a weight for each observation in the window.
- The function returns an instance of `pandas.Series` or `pandas.DataFrame` with the aggregated values.
- The aggregation function can be any of the following: `sum`, `mean`, `median`, `std`, `min`, `max`, `corr`, `cov`, `skew`, `kurt`, `apply`, `quantile`, `sem`, `rank`, etc.

In the context of the provided explanation, the rolling window function is explained in the context of how it can be used in pandas for various data analysis tasks, including data manipulation, data cleaning, and data modeling.

### Purpose of a Type Class for Series Objects

A type class for Series objects serves several purposes in data analysis and programming. Here are some of the key roles it can play:

1. **Type Safety**: By defining a type class for Series, you can ensure that users of the class are aware of the expected data type of the object they are creating. This can help prevent type-related errors and improve code readability.

2. **Encapsulation**: A type class can encapsulate the data and methods that operate on the Series, making it easier to define interfaces and abstract classes. This helps in organizing the codebase and promotes code reusability.

3. **Validation**: A type class can enforce certain constraints on the data that is stored in the Series, such as data types, ranges, or specific formats. This can help in ensuring that the data is in a consistent and predictable format.

4. **Performance**: In some cases, a type class can be used to optimize performance by providing methods that are optimized for specific data types or operations, which can improve the overall efficiency of the code.

5. **Interoperability**: By defining a common interface for Series, you can make it easier to integrate different data structures or libraries, promoting interoperability and reducing the need for manual conversions.

6. **Type Inference**: Many programming languages can infer the type of a variable based on the data it holds, a type class can help define this inference process, ensuring that the type is consistent throughout the code.

7. **Debugging**: The clarity of the type class can make it easier to debug issues related to the data types, as users will be more likely to specify the type when creating or manipulating Series.

### Example Implementation

Here's a simple example of a type class for Series in Python:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class SeriesType:
    data: list[float]
    min_value: float
    max_value: float
    dtype: type = float  # Default to float

    def __init__(self, data: list[float], min_value: float, max_value: float, dtype: type = float):
        self.data = data
        self.min_value = min_value
        self.max_value = max_value
        self.dtype = dtype

    def __repr__(self):
        return f""Series({self.data}, min_value={self.min_value}, max_value={self.max_value}, dtype={self.dtype.__name__})""

    def get_range(self):
        return self.max_value - self.min_value

# Example usage
series = SeriesType([1, 2, 3], 0, 10)
print(series)  # Output: Series([1, 2, 3], min_value=0, max_value=10, dtype=float)
print(series.get_range())  # Output: 10
```

This example defines a `SeriesType` class that includes a list of data, a minimum value, a maximum value, and an optional data type. It provides methods for getting the range of the series and a representation of the object. The `dtype` parameter defaults to `float`, but it can be changed to specify a different type. The class also includes a `__repr__` method for a nice string representation.","<s>[INST] What is the purpose of a type class for Series objects?
 [/INST]"")

Answer:

A type class for Series objects is used to group related objects of the same type together. This allows you to perform operations on those objects in a more structured way, and to easily identify the type of objects being manipulated.

Example use case:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a Series
s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3])

# Create a list of Series of the same type
s_list = [s, s, s]

# Group the Series in the list by their type
grouped = s_list.groupby(s.dtype)

# Perform operations on the grouped Series
result = grouped.sum()

print(result)
```

In this example, the `grouped` Series is grouped by the type of the Series in the list, and the sum of the Series is calculated. The result is a new Series with the same type as the original Series. This demonstrates how a type class can be used to group and perform operations on Series of the same type.","{'overall_score': 8, 'overall_rationale': 'The response presents a comprehensive explanation of the purpose of a type class for Series objects.

### Type Class for Series Objects

The purpose of a type class for Series objects is to define a common interface for different types of Series, allowing for easier creation, manipulation, and comparison. This can be particularly useful when working with data that may come in different formats or types, such as time series data or structured data.

### Usage

- When defining a type class for Series, you can specify how to handle different types of data and how to create the Series object.
- You can define attributes for the Series that are specific to each type (e.g., indexing, data type, etc.).
- The type class can also define methods for operations that can be performed on the Series, such as indexing or slicing.

### Example

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class SeriesType:
    data: list
    index: list
    dtype: type

    def __post_init__(self):
        if len(self.data)!= len(self.index):
            raise ValueError(""Data length does not match index length"")

    def __repr__(self):
        return f""Series({self.data}, {self.index}, {self.dtype.__name__})""

# Example usage
s = SeriesType([1, 2, 3], [""a"", ""b"", ""c""], int)
print(s)
```

### What is a Type Class for Series Objects?
A type class for Series objects is used to define the structure and properties of Series in a data science context. Specifically, it helps in defining how to represent a Series in a programming language, such as Python, which is commonly used for data analysis.

### Properties of a Type Class for Series Objects
- **Data Type**: The type of data that the Series represents (e.g., numeric, categorical, time-based).
- **Length**: The number of elements in the Series.
- **Index**: The index of the Series (if applicable).
- **Values**: The actual data points stored in the Series.
- **Methods**: Functions for manipulating the Series (e.g., indexing, slicing, indexing).

### Example of a Type Class for a Numeric Series
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import TypeClass

@dataclass
class NumericSeries:
    length: int
    values: list[float]

# Example usage
series = NumericSeries(10, [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
print(series.values)  # Output: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
```

### Conclusion
A type class for Series objects provides a structured approach to defining and manipulating Series in a data science context, allowing developers to work with data in a more readable and maintainable way. It helps in defining the properties and behavior of Series, making it easier to create and use them in applications.","{'overall_score': 6, 'overall_rationale': ""The answer attempts to address the question but lacks clarity and accuracy in the explanation of what a type class for Series objects represents, especially in the context of Python's existing data structures like the pandas Series.

Series
------

:class:`Series` is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data
type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). The axis
labels are collectively referred to as the **index**. The basic method to create a :class:`Series` is to call:

.. code-block:: python

   s = pd.Series(data, index=index)

Here, ``data`` can be many different things:

* a Python dict
* an ndarray
* a scalar value (like 5)

The passed **index** is a list of axis labels. The constructor's behavior
depends on **data**'s type:

**From ndarray**

If ``data`` is an ndarray, **index** must be the same length as **data**. If no
index is passed, one will be created having values ``[0, ..., len(data) - 1]``. .. ipython:: python

   s = pd.Series(np.random.randn(5), index=[""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"", ""e""])
   s
   s.index

   pd.Series(np.random.randn(5))

.. note::

    pandas supports non-unique index values. If an operation
    that does not support duplicate index values is attempted, an exception
    will be raised at that time. **From dict**

:class:`Series` can be instantiated from dicts:

.. ipython:: python

   d = {""b"": 1, ""a"": 0, ""c"": 2}
   pd.Series(d)

If an index is passed, the values in data corresponding to the labels in the
index will be pulled out. .. ipython:: python

   d = {""a"": 0.0, ""b"": 1.0, ""c"": 2.0}
   pd.Series(d)
   pd.Series(d, index=[""b"", ""c"", ""d"", ""a""])

.. note::

    NaN (not a number) is the standard missing data marker used in pandas. **From scalar value**

If ``data`` is a scalar value, the value will be repeated to match
the length of **index**. If the **index** is not provided, it defaults
to ``RangeIndex(1)``.
