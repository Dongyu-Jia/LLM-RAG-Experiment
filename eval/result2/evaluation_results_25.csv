","<s>[INST] What factors should be considered when choosing the parsing engine in pandas' `read_csv` method?
 [/INST] 

### Factors to Consider

1. **Data Type**:
   - Ensure the column types are compatible with pandas' data types.
   - For example, if you have a column of integers and another column of strings, ensure they can be parsed accordingly.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Consider whether the data has any missing values or outliers that need to be handled.
   - The parsing engine may have built-in methods for handling such data.

3. **Performance**:
   - If you need high performance, consider using the `read_csv` method with the `chunksize` parameter, which allows reading in small chunks of data at a time.
   - This can help reduce memory usage and improve performance when dealing with large datasets.

4. **Handling Special Characters**:
   - If your data contains non-standard characters (e.g., dates, times), ensure the parsing engine can handle them correctly.
   - For example, pandas can recognize and parse date strings in a standard format.

5. **Memory Usage**:
   - The parsing engine may allocate more memory if the data is large, especially if you're dealing with complex data types.
   - Consider whether your use case justifies the extra memory usage.

6. **Version Compatibility**:
   - Ensure the parsing engine used is compatible with your version of pandas.

7. **Custom Functions**:
   - If you need to implement custom functions for data parsing, be aware that the parsing engine may not support all functions out of the box.

### Example of Using the `read_csv` Method with Different Parsing Engines

```python
import pandas as pd

# Using `read_csv` with `chunksize` for performance
def read_csv_with_chunksize(data, chunksize):
    parsed_data = pd.read_csv(data, chunksize=chunksize)
    return parsed_data

# Using `read_csv` with built-in parsing engine
def read_csv_builtin(data):
    parsed_data = pd.read_csv(data)
    return parsed_data

# Example usage
data = 'your_data.csv'
chunked_data = pd.read_csv(data, chunksize=1000)

# Using custom parsing function
def custom_parse(data):
    # Custom parsing logic
    return data

# Using built-in parsing engine
parsed_data_builtin = read_csv_builtin(data)

# Using custom parsing function
parsed_data_custom = custom_parse(data)

# Both should produce the same output
print(parsed_data_builtin.equals(parsed_data_custom))
```

### Conclusion

Choosing the correct parsing engine for your use case depends on the specific requirements of your data, such as compatibility, performance, handling of special characters, memory usage, and version compatibility. Each parsing engine has its strengths and may be more suitable than others based on your needs. Always test and evaluate the performance of the chosen engine before deciding.","<s>[INST] What factors should be considered when choosing the parsing engine in pandas' `read_csv` method?

 [/INST] 
This section discusses the factors to consider when choosing the parsing engine in pandas' `read_csv` method. The options available include `pyarrow` and `fastparquet`, which are designed for performance and data type compatibility, respectively. Other factors may include the expected output type, the nature of the data, and the specific requirements of the application. Additionally, the choice of parsing engine may depend on the context in which the data is being read, such as whether it is being read from a file or a clipboard. Considerations such as compatibility with different data types and the potential for data loss may also be relevant. Ultimately, the choice of parsing engine will depend on the specific needs of the project and the requirements of the data being processed. 

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Performance**: The choice of parsing engine can affect the performance of the operation. `pyarrow` is generally faster than `fastparquet` for certain types of data.
- **Data Type Compatibility**: The parsing engine should be chosen based on the compatibility of the data types involved. For example, if the data contains strings and integers, the `fastparquet` engine may be more suitable.
- **Compatibility**: Consider the compatibility of the parsing engine with the target platform (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS).
- **Context**: The choice of parsing engine may depend on the specific requirements of the application or project.

**Conclusion:**

When choosing the parsing engine for `read_csv`, consider the factors mentioned above to select the most appropriate option based on the specific needs of the project. The choice of parsing engine will depend on the type of data being read, the expected output type, and the requirements of the application. 

**Final Thoughts:**

The choice of parsing engine should be tailored to the specific requirements of the project and the data being processed. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages, and the decision will ultimately depend on the context in which the data is being read.

The factors that should be considered when choosing the parsing engine in pandas' `read_csv` method include:

1. **Performance**: The parsing engine can significantly affect the speed of the `read_csv` operation. For example, the `pyarrow` engine is generally faster than the `fastparquet` engine.

2. **Compatibility**: The choice of engine may impact the compatibility of the data being read. For example, if you need to read data from a specific format, the parsing engine used may affect compatibility.

3. **Data types**: The engine may handle different data types differently, which can affect the handling of certain types of data, such as categorical or numerical data.

4. **Memory usage**: The engine may have different memory requirements, which can impact performance or memory usage, especially when dealing with large datasets.

5. **Support for advanced features**: The parsing engine may support additional features, such as support for parallel processing, which can be beneficial for large datasets.

6. **Ease of use**: The ease of use may vary depending on the specific parsing engine. For example, the `pyarrow` engine is often considered more Pythonic and easier to use.

7. **Integration with existing libraries**: The choice of engine may depend on the specific libraries or frameworks being used in your project.

8. **Platform compatibility**: The choice of engine may be platform-specific, and the compatibility may vary between Windows, macOS, and Linux.

9. **Development and testing**: The performance and compatibility of the chosen parsing engine may affect the development and testing process.

10. **Future compatibility**: The choice of engine may impact the future compatibility of the codebase, as the parsing engine may evolve over time.

Ultimately, the choice of parsing engine depends on the specific requirements of your project, including performance, compatibility, and features.

### Factors to Consider in Choosing the Parsing Engine

When selecting the parsing engine in pandas' `read_csv` method, several factors should be taken into account to ensure the chosen engine optimizes performance, handles different data types effectively, and meets the specific requirements of your project. Here are key considerations:

1. **Performance**: Different parsing engines have varying overheads in terms of memory allocation, parsing speed, and I/O operations. For high-performance applications, use an engine like `pandas.read_csv` with the `na_values=True`, which can significantly improve performance for large datasets.

2. **Data Type Handling**: The parsing engine should be able to handle various data types, including integers, floats, strings, and datetime objects. Some engines may excel at certain data types, while others may struggle with specific types.

3. **Memory Usage**: The amount of memory allocated by the parsing engine can impact the performance and memory usage of your application. Some engines may use more memory than others, especially if you're working with large datasets.

4. **Compatibility**: Consider the compatibility of the chosen parsing engine with the specific libraries and tools you're using in your project. Different engines may have different APIs or handle certain data types differently.

5. **Error Handling**: The parsing engine should handle errors gracefully. Some engines may return more informative error messages, which can be helpful for debugging and understanding the nature of the errors.

6. **Synchronization**: If you're working in a multi-threaded environment, consider the synchronization requirements of the parsing engine, especially if you're reading large files concurrently.

7. **Platform Support**: The choice of parsing engine may depend on the operating system you're targeting. Some engines may be more suitable for Windows, while others may be more effective on Linux or macOS.

### Example Usage

For example, when reading a CSV file, you might choose to use `pandas.read_csv` with `na_values=True` for handling missing values, and `engine='c'` for optimal performance:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('file.csv', na_values=True, engine='c')

# Alternatively, with the specified engine
df_c = pd.read_csv('file.csv', engine='c')
```

Version 0.13.1 (February 3, 2014)
---------------------------------

{{ header }}



This is a minor release from 0.13.0 and includes a small number of API changes, several new features,
enhancements, and performance improvements along with a large number of bug fixes. We recommend that all
users upgrade to this version. Highlights include:

- Added ``infer_datetime_format`` keyword to ``read_csv/to_datetime`` to allow speedups for homogeneously formatted datetimes. - Will intelligently limit display precision for datetime/timedelta formats. - Enhanced Panel :meth:`~pandas.Panel.apply` method. - Suggested tutorials in new :ref:`Tutorials<tutorials>` section. - Our pandas ecosystem is growing, We now feature related projects in a new `ecosystem page <https://pandas.pydata.org/community/ecosystem.html>`_ section. - Much work has been taking place on improving the docs, and a new :ref:`Contributing<contributing>` section has been added. - Even though it may only be of interest to devs, we <3 our new CI status page: `ScatterCI <http://scatterci.github.io/pydata/pandas>`__. .. warning::

   0.13.1 fixes a bug that was caused by a combination of having numpy < 1.8, and doing
   chained assignment on a string-like array. Chained indexing can have unexpected results and should generally be avoided. This would previously segfault:

   .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df[""A""].iloc[0] = np.nan

   The recommended way to do this type of assignment is:

   .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df.loc[0, ""A""] = np.nan
      df

Output formatting enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- df.info() view now display dtype info per column (:issue:`5682`)

- df.info() now honors the option ``max_info_rows``, to disable null counts for large frames (:issue:`5974`)

  .. ipython:: python

     max_info_rows = pd.get_option(""max_info_rows"")

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         {
             ""A"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""B"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""C"": pd.date_range(""20130101"", periods=10),
         }
     )
     df.iloc[3:6, [0, 2]] = np.nan

  .. ipython:: python

     # set to not display the null counts
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", 0)
     df.info()

  .. ipython:: python

     # this is the default (same as in 0.13.0)
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", max_info_rows)
     df.info()

- Add ``show_dimensions`` display option for the new DataFrame repr to control whether the dimensions print. .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", False)
      df

      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", True)
      df

- The ``ArrayFormatter`` for ``datetime`` and ``timedelta64`` now intelligently
  limit precision based on the values in the array (:issue:`3401`)

  Previously output might look like:

  .. code-block:: text

        age                 today               diff
      0 2001-01-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 4491 days, 00:00:00
      1 2004-06-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 3244 days, 00:00:00

  Now the output looks like:

  .. ipython:: python

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         [pd.Timestamp(""20010101""), pd.Timestamp(""20040601"")], columns=[""age""]
     )
     df[""today""] = pd.Timestamp(""20130419"")
     df[""diff""] = df[""today""] - df[""age""]
     df

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``-NaN`` and ``-nan`` to the default set of NA values (:issue:`5952`). See :ref:`NA Values <io.na_values>`. - Added ``Series.str.get_dummies`` vectorized string method (:issue:`6021`), to extract
  dummy/indicator variables for separated string columns:

  .. ipython:: python

      s = pd.Series([""a"", ""a|b"", np.nan, ""a|c""])
      s.str.get_dummies(sep=""|"")

- Added the ``NDFrame.equals()`` method to compare if two NDFrames are
  equal have equal axes, dtypes, and values. Added the
  ``array_equivalent`` function to compare if two ndarrays are
  equal. NaNs in identical locations are treated as
  equal. (:issue:`5283`) See also :ref:`the docs<basics.equals>` for a motivating example. .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [""foo"", 0, np.nan]})
      df2 = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [np.nan, 0, ""foo""]}, index=[2, 1, 0])
      df.equals(df2)
      df.equals(df2.sort_index())

- ``DataFrame.apply`` will use the ``reduce`` argument to determine whether a
  ``Series`` or a ``DataFrame`` should be returned when the ``DataFrame`` is
  empty (:issue:`6007`). Previously, calling ``DataFrame.apply`` an empty ``DataFrame`` would return
  either a ``DataFrame`` if there were no columns, or the function being
  applied would be called with an empty ``Series`` to guess whether a
  ``Series`` or ``DataFrame`` should be returned:

  .. code-block:: ipython

    In [32]: def applied_func(col):
      ....:    print(""Apply function being called with: "", col)
      ....:    return col.sum()
      ....:

    In [33]: empty = DataFrame(columns=['a', 'b'])

    In [34]: empty.apply(applied_func)
    Apply function being called with:  Series([], Length: 0, dtype: float64)
    Out[34]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

  Now, when ``apply`` is called on an empty ``DataFrame``: if the ``reduce``
  argument is ``True`` a ``Series`` will returned, if it is ``False`` a
  ``DataFrame`` will be returned, and if it is ``None`` (the default) the
  function being applied will be called with an empty series to try and guess
  the return type. .. code-block:: ipython

    In [35]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=True)
    Out[35]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

    In [36]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=False)
    Out[36]:
    Empty DataFrame
    Columns: [a, b]
    Index: []

    [0 rows x 2 columns]

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _whatsnew_0200.enhancements.agg:

Method ``agg`` API for DataFrame/Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Series & DataFrame have been enhanced to support the aggregation API. This is a familiar API
from groupby, window operations, and resampling. This allows aggregation operations in a concise way
by using :meth:`~DataFrame.agg` and :meth:`~DataFrame.transform`. The full documentation
is :ref:`here <basics.aggregate>` (:issue:`1623`). Here is a sample

.. ipython:: python

   df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 3), columns=['A', 'B', 'C'],
                     index=pd.date_range('1/1/2000', periods=10))
   df.iloc[3:7] = np.nan
   df

One can operate using string function names, callables, lists, or dictionaries of these. Using a single function is equivalent to ``.apply``. .. ipython:: python

   df.agg('sum')

Multiple aggregations with a list of functions. .. ipython:: python

   df.agg(['sum', 'min'])

Using a dict provides the ability to apply specific aggregations per column. You will get a matrix-like output of all of the aggregators. The output has one column
per unique function. Those functions applied to a particular column will be ``NaN``:

.. ipython:: python

   df.agg({'A': ['sum', 'min'], 'B': ['min', 'max']})

The API also supports a ``.transform()`` function for broadcasting results. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   df.transform(['abs', lambda x: x - x.min()])

When presented with mixed dtypes that cannot be aggregated, ``.agg()`` will only take the valid
aggregations. This is similar to how groupby ``.agg()`` works. (:issue:`15015`)

.. ipython:: python

   df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3],
                      'B': [1., 2., 3.],
                      'C': ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'],
                      'D': pd.date_range('20130101', periods=3)})
   df.dtypes

.. code-block:: python

   In [10]: df.agg(['min', 'sum'])
   Out[10]:
        A    B          C          D
   min  1  1.0        bar 2013-01-01
   sum  6  6.0  foobarbaz        NaT

.. _whatsnew_0200.enhancements.dataio_dtype:

Keyword argument ``dtype`` for data IO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``'python'`` engine for :func:`read_csv`, as well as the :func:`read_fwf` function for parsing
fixed-width text files and :func:`read_excel` for parsing Excel files, now accept the ``dtype`` keyword argument for specifying the types of specific columns (:issue:`14295`). See the :ref:`io docs <io.dtypes>` for more information.

### Contributors Version Range

The version range mentioned in the context typically refers to a specific range of versions that the contributors are associated with. This can be relevant in the context of open-source projects or software development where the contributors are identified by their version ranges. 

### Example

- **Version Range:** `[1.0.0, 2.0.0]`
  - This suggests that the contributors associated with this version range are those who worked on the project from version 1.0.0 up to and including version 2.0.0.

### Context

Version 0.13.1 (February 3, 2014)
---------------------------------

{{ header }}



This is a minor release from 0.13.0 and includes a small number of API changes, several new features,
enhancements, and performance improvements along with a large number of bug fixes. We recommend that all
users upgrade to this version. Highlights include:

- Added ``infer_datetime_format`` keyword to ``read_csv/to_datetime`` to allow speedups for homogeneously formatted datetimes. - Will intelligently limit display precision for datetime/timedelta formats. - Enhanced Panel :meth:`~pandas.Panel.apply` method. - Suggested tutorials in new :ref:`Tutorials<tutorials>` section. - Our pandas ecosystem is growing, We now feature related projects in a new `ecosystem page <https://pandas.pydata.org/community/ecosystem.html>`_ section. - Much work has been taking place on improving the docs, and a new :ref:`Contributing<contributing>` section has been added. - Even though it may only be of interest to devs, we <3 our new CI status page: `ScatterCI <http://scatterci.github.io/pydata/pandas>`__. .. warning::

   0.13.1 fixes a bug that was caused by a combination of having numpy < 1.8, and doing
   chained assignment on a string-like array. Chained indexing can have unexpected results and should generally be avoided. This would previously segfault:

   .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df[""A""].iloc[0] = np.nan

   The recommended way to do this type of assignment is:

   .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df.loc[0, ""A""] = np.nan
      df

Output formatting enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- df.info() view now display dtype info per column (:issue:`5682`)

- df.info() now honors the option ``max_info_rows``, to disable null counts for large frames (:issue:`5974`)

  .. ipython:: python

     max_info_rows = pd.get_option(""max_info_rows"")

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         {
             ""A"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""B"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""C"": pd.date_range(""20130101"", periods=10),
         }
     )
     df.iloc[3:6, [0, 2]] = np.nan

  .. ipython:: python

     # set to not display the null counts
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", 0)
     df.info()

  .. ipython:: python

     # this is the default (same as in 0.13.0)
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", max_info_rows)
     df.info()

- Add ``show_dimensions`` display option for the new DataFrame repr to control whether the dimensions print. .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", False)
      df

      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", True)
      df

- The ``ArrayFormatter`` for ``datetime`` and ``timedelta64`` now intelligently
  limit precision based on the values in the array (:issue:`3401`)

  Previously output might look like:

  .. code-block:: text

        age                 today               diff
      0 2001-01-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 4491 days, 00:00:00
      1 2004-06-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 3244 days, 00:00:00

  Now the output looks like:

  .. ipython:: python

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         [pd.Timestamp(""20010101""), pd.Timestamp(""20040601"")], columns=[""age""]
     )
     df[""today""] = pd.Timestamp(""20130419"")
     df[""diff""] = df[""today""] - df[""age""]
     df

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``-NaN`` and ``-nan`` to the default set of NA values (:issue:`5952`). See :ref:`NA Values <io.na_values>`. - Added ``Series.str.get_dummies`` vectorized string method (:issue:`6021`), to extract
  dummy/indicator variables for separated string columns:

  .. ipython:: python

      s = pd.Series([""a"", ""a|b"", np.nan, ""a|c""])
      s.str.get_dummies(sep=""|"")

- Added the ``NDFrame.equals()`` method to compare if two NDFrames are
  equal have equal axes, dtypes, and values. Added the
  ``array_equivalent`` function to compare if two ndarrays are
  equal. NaNs in identical locations are treated as
  equal. (:issue:`5283`) See also :ref:`the docs<basics.equals>` for a motivating example. .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [""foo"", 0, np.nan]})
      df2 = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [np.nan, 0, ""foo""]}, index=[2, 1, 0])
      df.equals(df2)
      df.equals(df2.sort_index())

- ``DataFrame.apply`` will use the ``reduce`` argument to determine whether a
  ``Series`` or a ``DataFrame`` should be returned when the ``DataFrame`` is
  empty (:issue:`6007`). Previously, calling ``DataFrame.apply`` an empty ``DataFrame`` would return
  either a ``DataFrame`` if there were no columns, or the function being
  applied would be called with an empty ``Series`` to guess whether a
  ``Series`` or ``DataFrame`` should be returned:

  .. code-block:: ipython

    In [32]: def applied_func(col):
      ....:    print(""Apply function being called with: "", col)
      ....:    return col.sum()
      ....:

    In [33]: empty = DataFrame(columns=['a', 'b'])

    In [34]: empty.apply(applied_func)
    Apply function being called with:  Series([], Length: 0, dtype: float64)
    Out[34]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

  Now, when ``apply`` is called on an empty ``DataFrame``: if the ``reduce``
  argument is ``True`` a ``Series`` will returned, if it is ``False`` a
  ``DataFrame`` will be returned, and if it is ``None`` (the default) the
  function being applied will be called with an empty series to try and guess
  the return type. .. code-block:: ipython

    In [35]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=True)
    Out[35]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

    In [36]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=False)
    Out[36]:
    Empty DataFrame
    Columns: [a, b]
    Index: []

    [0 rows x 2 columns]

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _whatsnew_0200.enhancements.agg:

Method ``agg`` API for DataFrame/Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Series & DataFrame have been enhanced to support the aggregation API. This is a familiar API
from groupby, window operations, and resampling. This allows aggregation operations in a concise way
by using :meth:`~DataFrame.agg` and :meth:`~DataFrame.transform`. The full documentation
is :ref:`here <basics.aggregate>` (:issue:`1623`). Here is a sample

.. ipython:: python

   df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 3), columns=['A', 'B', 'C'],
                     index=pd.date_range('1/1/2000', periods=10))
   df.iloc[3:7] = np.nan
   df

One can operate using string function names, callables, lists, or dictionaries of these. Using a single function is equivalent to ``.apply``. .. ipython:: python

   df.agg('sum')

Multiple aggregations with a list of functions. .. ipython:: python

   df.agg(['sum', 'min'])

Using a dict provides the ability to apply specific aggregations per column. You will get a matrix-like output of all of the aggregators. The output has one column
per unique function. Those functions applied to a particular column will be ``NaN``:

.. ipython:: python

   df.agg({'A': ['sum', 'min'], 'B': ['min', 'max']})

The API also supports a ``.transform()`` function for broadcasting results. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   df.transform(['abs', lambda x: x - x.min()])

When presented with mixed dtypes that cannot be aggregated, ``.agg()`` will only take the valid
aggregations. This is similar to how groupby ``.agg()`` works. (:issue:`15015`)

.. ipython:: python

   df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3],
                      'B': [1., 2., 3.],
                      'C': ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'],
                      'D': pd.date_range('20130101', periods=3)})
   df.dtypes

.. code-block:: python

   In [10]: df.agg(['min', 'sum'])
   Out[10]:
        A    B          C          D
   min  1  1.0        bar 2013-01-01
   sum  6  6.0  foobarbaz        NaT

.. _whatsnew_0200.enhancements.dataio_dtype:

Keyword argument ``dtype`` for data IO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``'python'`` engine for :func:`read_csv`, as well as the :func:`read_fwf` function for parsing
fixed-width text files and :func:`read_excel` for parsing Excel files, now accept the ``dtype`` keyword argument for specifying the types of specific columns (:issue:`14295`). See the :ref:`io docs <io.dtypes>` for more information.

Context 1: .. _whatsnew_0131:

Version 0.13.1 (February 3, 2014)
---------------------------------

{{ header }}



This is a minor release from 0.13.0 and includes a small number of API changes, several new features,
enhancements, and performance improvements along with a large number of bug fixes. We recommend that all
users upgrade to this version. Highlights include:

- Added ``infer_datetime_format`` keyword to ``read_csv/to_datetime`` to allow speedups for homogeneously formatted datetimes. - Will intelligently limit display precision for datetime/timedelta formats. - Enhanced Panel :meth:`~pandas.Panel.apply` method. - Suggested tutorials in new :ref:`Tutorials<tutorials>` section. - Our pandas ecosystem is growing, We now feature related projects in a new `ecosystem page <https://pandas.pydata.org/community/ecosystem.html>`_ section. - Much work has been taking place on improving the docs, and a new :ref:`Contributing<contributing>` section has been added. - Even though it may only be of interest to devs, we <3 our new CI status page: `ScatterCI <http://scatterci.github.io/pydata/pandas>`__. .. warning::

   0.13.1 fixes a bug that was caused by a combination of having numpy < 1.8, and doing
   chained assignment on a string-like array. Chained indexing can have unexpected results and should generally be avoided. This would previously segfault:

   .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df[""A""].iloc[0] = np.nan

   The recommended way to do this type of assignment is:

   .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df.loc[0, ""A""] = np.nan
      df

Output formatting enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- df.info() view now display dtype info per column (:issue:`5682`)

- df.info() now honors the option ``max_info_rows``, to disable null counts for large frames (:issue:`5974`)

  .. ipython:: python

     max_info_rows = pd.get_option(""max_info_rows"")

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         {
             ""A"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""B"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""C"": pd.date_range(""20130101"", periods=10),
         }
     )
     df.iloc[3:6, [0, 2]] = np.nan

  .. ipython:: python

     # set to not display the null counts
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", 0)
     df.info()

  .. ipython:: python

     # this is the default (same as in 0.13.0)
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", max_info_rows)
     df.info()

- Add ``show_dimensions`` display option for the new DataFrame repr to control whether the dimensions print. .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", False)
      df

      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", True)
      df

- The ``ArrayFormatter`` for ``datetime`` and ``timedelta64`` now intelligently
  limit precision based on the values in the array (:issue:`3401`)

  Previously output might look like:

  .. code-block:: text

        age                 today               diff
      0 2001-01-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 4491 days, 00:00:00
      1 2004-06-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 3244 days, 00:00:00

  Now the output looks like:

  .. ipython:: python

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         [pd.Timestamp(""20010101""), pd.Timestamp(""20040601"")], columns=[""age""]
     )
     df[""today""] = pd.Timestamp(""20130419"")
     df[""diff""] = df[""today""] - df[""age""]
     df

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``-NaN`` and ``-nan`` to the default set of NA values (:issue:`5952`). See :ref:`NA Values <io.na_values>`. - Added ``Series.str.get_dummies`` vectorized string method (:issue:`6021`), to extract
  dummy/indicator variables for separated string columns:

  .. ipython:: python

      s = pd.Series([""a"", ""a|b"", np.nan, ""a|c""])
      s.str.get_dummies(sep=""|"")

- Added the ``NDFrame.equals()`` method to compare if two NDFrames are
  equal have equal axes, dtypes, and values. Added the
  ``array_equivalent`` function to compare if two ndarrays are
  equal. NaNs in identical locations are treated as
  equal. (:issue:`5283`) See also :ref:`the docs<basics.equals>` for a motivating example. .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [""foo"", 0, np.nan]})
      df2 = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [np.nan, 0, ""foo""]}, index=[2, 1, 0])
      df.equals(df2)
      df.equals(df2.sort_index())

- ``DataFrame.apply`` will use the ``reduce`` argument to determine whether a
  ``Series`` or a ``DataFrame`` should be returned when the ``DataFrame`` is
  empty (:issue:`6007`). Previously, calling ``DataFrame.apply`` an empty ``DataFrame`` would return
  either a ``DataFrame`` if there were no columns, or the function being
  applied would be called with an empty ``Series`` to guess whether a
  ``Series`` or ``DataFrame`` should be returned:

  .. code-block:: ipython

    In [32]: def applied_func(col):
      ....:    print(""Apply function being called with: "", col)
      ....:    return col.sum()
      ....:

    In [33]: empty = DataFrame(columns=['a', 'b'])

    In [34]: empty.apply(applied_func)
    Apply function being called with:  Series([], Length: 0, dtype: float64)
    Out[34]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

  Now, when ``apply`` is called on an empty ``DataFrame``: if the ``reduce``
  argument is ``True`` a ``Series`` will returned, if it is ``False`` a
  ``DataFrame`` will be returned, and if it is ``None`` (the default) the
  function being applied will be called with an empty series to try and guess
  the return type. .. code-block:: ipython

    In [35]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=True)
    Out[35]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

    In [36]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=False)
    Out[36]:
    Empty DataFrame
    Columns: [a, b]
    Index: []

    [0 rows x 2 columns]

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _whatsnew_0200.enhancements.agg:

Method ``agg`` API for DataFrame/Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Series & DataFrame have been enhanced to support the aggregation API. This is a familiar API
from groupby, window operations, and resampling. This allows aggregation operations in a concise way
by using :meth:`~DataFrame.agg` and :meth:`~DataFrame.transform`. The full documentation
is :ref:`here <basics.aggregate>` (:issue:`1623`). Here is a sample

.. ipython:: python

   df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 3), columns=['A', 'B', 'C'],
                     index=pd.date_range('1/1/2000', periods=10))
   df.iloc[3:7] = np.nan
   df

One can operate using string function names, callables, lists, or dictionaries of these. Using a single function is equivalent to ``.apply``. .. ipython:: python

   df.agg('sum')

Multiple aggregations with a list of functions. .. ipython:: python

   df.agg(['sum', 'min'])

Using a dict provides the ability to apply specific aggregations per column. You will get a matrix-like output of all of the aggregators. The output has one column
per unique function. Those functions applied to a particular column will be ``NaN``:

.. ipython:: python

   df.agg({'A': ['sum', 'min'], 'B': ['min', 'max']})

The API also supports a ``.transform()`` function for broadcasting results. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   df.transform(['abs', lambda x: x - x.min()])

When presented with mixed dtypes that cannot be aggregated, ``.agg()`` will only take the valid
aggregations. This is similar to how groupby ``.agg()`` works. (:issue:`15015`)

.. ipython:: python

   df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3],
                      'B': [1., 2., 3.],
                      'C': ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'],
                      'D': pd.date_range('20130101', periods=3)})
   df.dtypes

.. code-block:: python

   In [10]: df.agg(['min', 'sum'])
   Out[10]:
        A    B          C          D
   min  1  1.0        bar 2013-01-01
   sum  6  6.0  foobarbaz        NaT

.. _whatsnew_0200.enhancements.dataio_dtype:

Keyword argument ``dtype`` for data IO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``'python'`` engine for :func:`read_csv`, as well as the :func:`read_fwf` function for parsing
fixed-width text files and :func:`read_excel` for parsing Excel files, now accept the ``dtype`` keyword argument for specifying the types of specific columns (:issue:`14295`). See the :ref:`io docs <io.dtypes>` for more information.

Version 0.13.1 (February 3, 2014)
---------------------------------

{{ header }}



This is a minor release from 0.13.0 and includes a small number of API changes, several new features,
enhancements, and performance improvements along with a large number of bug fixes. We recommend that all
users upgrade to this version. Highlights include:

- Added ``infer_datetime_format`` keyword to ``read_csv/to_datetime`` to allow speedups for homogeneously formatted datetimes. - Will intelligently limit display precision for datetime/timedelta formats. - Enhanced Panel :meth:`~pandas.Panel.apply` method. - Suggested tutorials in new :ref:`Tutorials<tutorials>` section. - Our pandas ecosystem is growing, We now feature related projects in a new `ecosystem page <https://pandas.pydata.org/community/ecosystem.html>`_ section. - Much work has been taking place on improving the docs, and a new :ref:`Contributing<contributing>` section has been added. - Even though it may only be of interest to devs, we <3 our new CI status page: `ScatterCI <http://scatterci.github.io/pydata/pandas>`__. .. warning::

   0.13.1 fixes a bug that was caused by a combination of having numpy < 1.8, and doing
   chained assignment on a string-like array. Chained indexing can have unexpected results and should generally be avoided. This would previously segfault:

   .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df[""A""].iloc[0] = np.nan

   The recommended way to do this type of assignment is:

   .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df.loc[0, ""A""] = np.nan
      df

Output formatting enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- df.info() view now display dtype info per column (:issue:`5682`)

- df.info() now honors the option ``max_info_rows``, to disable null counts for large frames (:issue:`5974`)

  .. ipython:: python

     max_info_rows = pd.get_option(""max_info_rows"")

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         {
             ""A"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""B"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""C"": pd.date_range(""20130101"", periods=10),
         }
     )
     df.iloc[3:6, [0, 2]] = np.nan

  .. ipython:: python

     # set to not display the null counts
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", 0)
     df.info()

  .. ipython:: python

     # this is the default (same as in 0.13.0)
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", max_info_rows)
     df.info()

- Add ``show_dimensions`` display option for the new DataFrame repr to control whether the dimensions print. .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", False)
      df

      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", True)
      df

- The ``ArrayFormatter`` for ``datetime`` and ``timedelta64`` now intelligently
  limit precision based on the values in the array (:issue:`3401`)

  Previously output might look like:

  .. code-block:: text

        age                 today               diff
      0 2001-01-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 4491 days, 00:00:00
      1 2004-06-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 3244 days, 00:00:00

  Now the output looks like:

  .. ipython:: python

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         [pd.Timestamp(""20010101""), pd.Timestamp(""20040601"")], columns=[""age""]
     )
     df[""today""] = pd.Timestamp(""20130419"")
     df[""diff""] = df[""today""] - df[""age""]
     df

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``-NaN`` and ``-nan`` to the default set of NA values (:issue:`5952`). See :ref:`NA Values <io.na_values>`. - Added ``Series.str.get_dummies`` vectorized string method (:issue:`6021`), to extract
  dummy/indicator variables for separated string columns:

  .. ipython:: python

      s = pd.Series([""a"", ""a|b"", np.nan, ""a|c""])
      s.str.get_dummies(sep=""|"")

- Added the ``NDFrame.equals()`` method to compare if two NDFrames are
  equal have equal axes, dtypes, and values. Added the
  ``array_equivalent`` function to compare if two ndarrays are
  equal. NaNs in identical locations are treated as
  equal. (:issue:`5283`) See also :ref:`the docs<basics.equals>` for a motivating example. .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [""foo"", 0, np.nan]})
      df2 = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [np.nan, 0, ""foo""]}, index=[2, 1, 0])
      df.equals(df2)
      df.equals(df2.sort_index())

- ``DataFrame.apply`` will use the ``reduce`` argument to determine whether a
  ``Series`` or a ``DataFrame`` should be returned when the ``DataFrame`` is
  empty (:issue:`6007`). Previously, calling ``DataFrame.apply`` an empty ``DataFrame`` would return
  either a ``DataFrame`` if there were no columns, or the function being
  applied would be called with an empty ``Series`` to guess whether a
  ``Series`` or ``DataFrame`` should be returned:

  .. code-block:: ipython

    In [32]: def applied_func(col):
      ....:    print(""Apply function being called with: "", col)
      ....:    return col.sum()
      ....:

    In [33]: empty = DataFrame(columns=['a', 'b'])

    In [34]: empty.apply(applied_func)
    Apply function being called with:  Series([], Length: 0, dtype: float64)
    Out[34]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

  Now, when ``apply`` is called on an empty ``DataFrame``: if the ``reduce``
  argument is ``True`` a ``Series`` will returned, if it is ``False`` a
  ``DataFrame`` will be returned, and if it is ``None`` (the default) the
  function being applied will be called with an empty series to try and guess
  the return type. .. code-block:: ipython

    In [35]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=True)
    Out[35]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

    In [36]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=False)
    Out[36]:
    Empty DataFrame
    Columns: [a, b]
    Index: []

    [0 rows x 2 columns]

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _whatsnew_0200.enhancements.agg:

Method ``agg`` API for DataFrame/Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Series & DataFrame have been enhanced to support the aggregation API. This is a familiar API
from groupby, window operations, and resampling. This allows aggregation operations in a concise way
by using :meth:`~DataFrame.agg` and :meth:`~DataFrame.transform`. The full documentation
is :ref:`here <basics.aggregate>` (:issue:`1623`). Here is a sample

.. ipython:: python

   df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 3), columns=['A', 'B', 'C'],
                     index=pd.date_range('1/1/2000', periods=10))
   df.iloc[3:7] = np.nan
   df

One can operate using string function names, callables, lists, or dictionaries of these. Using a single function is equivalent to ``.apply``. .. ipython:: python

   df.agg('sum')

Multiple aggregations with a list of functions. .. ipython:: python

   df.agg(['sum', 'min'])

Using a dict provides the ability to apply specific aggregations per column. You will get a matrix-like output of all of the aggregators. The output has one column
per unique function. Those functions applied to a particular column will be ``NaN``:

.. ipython:: python

   df.agg({'A': ['sum', 'min'], 'B': ['min', 'max']})

The API also supports a ``.transform()`` function for broadcasting results. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   df.transform(['abs', lambda x: x - x.min()])

When presented with mixed dtypes that cannot be aggregated, ``.agg()`` will only take the valid
aggregations. This is similar to how groupby ``.agg()`` works. (:issue:`15015`)

.. ipython:: python

   df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3],
                      'B': [1., 2., 3.],
                      'C': ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'],
                      'D': pd.date_range('20130101', periods=3)})
   df.dtypes

.. code-block:: python

   In [10]: df.agg(['min', 'sum'])
   Out[10]:
        A    B          C          D
   min  1  1.0        bar 2013-01-01
   sum  6  6.0  foobarbaz        NaT

.. _whatsnew_0200.enhancements.dataio_dtype:

Keyword argument ``dtype`` for data IO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``'python'`` engine for :func:`read_csv`, as well as the :func:`read_fwf` function for parsing
fixed-width text files and :func:`read_excel` for parsing Excel files, now accept the ``dtype`` keyword argument for specifying the types of specific columns (:issue:`14295`). See the :ref:`io docs <io.dtypes>` for more information.

",True,-2.0,,"<s>[INST] What is the significance of version numbers in software development?
 [/INST] 

In software development, version numbers are used to identify the release or version of a software application, program, or project. The significance of version numbers lies in several aspects:

1. **Identifying Updates and Changes**: Version numbers provide a way to track changes made to the software over time. They help developers and users understand what new features, bug fixes, or enhancements have been added, as well as what changes have been made to the existing code.

2. **Compatibility**: Version numbers can indicate whether the software is compatible with other software or systems. Different versions may have varying levels of compatibility, which can affect how they interact with other applications or systems.

3. **Support and Maintenance**: Version numbers can indicate when a software is no longer supported, and when maintenance or updates may be available. This helps in deciding whether to upgrade or stick with the existing version.

4. **Release Notes**: The version number often accompanies release notes that contain detailed information about the changes, new features, and any known issues resolved.

5. **Tracking Development Progress**: Version numbers can serve as a metric to gauge the progress of a project or software development. They can help developers understand how their work is progressing and how it compares to previous versions.

6. **Security Updates**: In software security contexts, version numbers can indicate when security patches are available for a particular version, helping to protect against known vulnerabilities.

In summary, version numbers are a crucial part of the software development lifecycle, providing a framework for managing changes, tracking compatibility, and facilitating the release of new versions with features and security updates.","<s>[INST] What is the significance of version numbers in software development?

### Significance of Version Numbers in Software Development

Version numbers play a crucial role in software development, serving several key purposes. Here are some of the most significant aspects:

1. **Tracking Changes and Updates**: Version numbers help developers keep track of changes made to the software over time. This is particularly useful for managing different versions of the same application, allowing users to identify which version contains new features, bug fixes, or security patches.

2. **Compatibility and Cross-Platform Support**: Different versions of a software product may be compatible with different operating systems or hardware configurations. Version numbers can help identify which version is compatible with a particular platform, ensuring that users can switch between versions without worrying about compatibility issues.

3. **Release Notes and Documentation**: Version numbers often accompany release notes and documentation that describe the changes, new features, and any known issues associated with the software. This information is essential for users to understand the software's capabilities and limitations.

4. **Security and Bug Fixing**: Version numbers can help track when security vulnerabilities have been fixed or when new features have been added. This allows developers to release software in a controlled manner, ensuring that users receive security patches and bug fixes in a timely manner.

5. **User Experience**: By using version numbers, developers can inform users about the software's stability and reliability. This can be especially important in software applications where users may be concerned about the software's performance or compatibility with their specific setup.

6. **Marketing and Sales**: Version numbers can also be used to create a sense of urgency or to promote new releases. For example, a software company might use a version number to indicate a new major release, which might include significant changes or new features.

7. **Backward Compatibility**: Version numbers can help in backward compatibility, allowing users to upgrade from older versions to newer ones. This ensures that users can transition to newer versions while minimizing disruptions.

In summary, version numbers are a fundamental aspect of software development, enabling developers to manage changes, ensure compatibility, communicate changes to users, and facilitate marketing and sales efforts. They provide a clear and structured way to track and release software versions, which is essential for a smooth user experience and for the software's long-term success.","{'overall_score': 9, 'overall_rationale': 'The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the significance of version numbers in software development.

### Significance of Version Numbers in Software Development

Version numbers play a crucial role in software development as they help track changes, updates, and compatibility issues over time. Here are some key aspects of the significance of version numbers in software development:

1. **Tracking Changes**: Version numbers enable developers to keep track of changes made to the software over time. This helps in understanding which features have been added, removed, or modified, allowing for a more informed decision-making process.

2. **Compatibility**: Version numbers help in ensuring that the software remains compatible with different environments, platforms, or operating systems. Different versions may have different requirements for dependencies, and using the correct version ensures that the software functions as expected across various scenarios.

3. **Release Management**: Version numbers are used in the release management process. They help in determining whether a new version is a release, and it marks the end of an iteration or a significant milestone in the software development lifecycle.

4. **Documentation and Support**: Version numbers can serve as a reference point for documentation and support. They help in organizing and categorizing updates, making it easier for users to find relevant information and troubleshooting resources.

5. **Security Updates**: With the rapid pace of software development, version numbers can also indicate when security updates are available. Each version number may include a new set of security patches, which can significantly enhance the overall security posture of the software.

6. **Long-term Planning**: Understanding the version history allows for long-term planning. It helps in setting goals and strategies that align with the development roadmap, ensuring that the software remains relevant and competitive in the market over time.

7. **Debugging and Troubleshooting**: Version numbers can be used to identify which version of the software is causing issues, allowing developers to pinpoint and fix problems more efficiently.

In summary, version numbers are a fundamental aspect of software development, serving as a means to track changes, ensure compatibility, and facilitate communication among stakeholders. They play a crucial role in the release management process and are essential for software development to progress effectively.","{'overall_score': 9, 'overall_rationale': 'The answer provides a well-rounded explanation that thoroughly covers the significance of version numbers in software development.

Version 0.7.3 (April 12, 2012)
------------------------------

{{ header }}


This is a minor release from 0.7.2 and fixes many minor bugs and adds a number
of nice new features. There are also a couple of API changes to note; these
should not affect very many users, and we are inclined to call them ""bug fixes""
even though they do constitute a change in behavior. See the :ref:`full release
notes <release>` or issue
tracker on GitHub for a complete list. New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New :ref:`fixed width file reader <io.fwf>`, ``read_fwf``
- New :ref:`scatter_matrix <visualization.scatter_matrix>` function for making
  a scatter plot matrix

.. code-block:: python

   from pandas.tools.plotting import scatter_matrix

   scatter_matrix(df, alpha=0.2)  # noqa F821


- Add ``stacked`` argument to Series and DataFrame's ``plot`` method for
  :ref:`stacked bar plots <visualization.barplot>`. .. code-block:: python

   df.plot(kind=""bar"", stacked=True)  # noqa F821


.. code-block:: python

   df.plot(kind=""barh"", stacked=True)  # noqa F821


- Add log x and y :ref:`scaling options <visualization.basic>` to
  ``DataFrame.plot`` and ``Series.plot``
- Add ``kurt`` methods to Series and DataFrame for computing kurtosis


NA boolean comparison API change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reverted some changes to how NA values (represented typically as ``NaN`` or
``None``) are handled in non-numeric Series:

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [1]: series = pd.Series([""Steve"", np.nan, ""Joe""])

   In [2]: series == ""Steve""
   Out[2]:
   0     True
   1    False
   2    False
   Length: 3, dtype: bool

   In [3]: series != ""Steve""
   Out[3]:
   0    False
   1     True
   2     True
   Length: 3, dtype: bool

In comparisons, NA / NaN will always come through as ``False`` except with
``!=`` which is ``True``. *Be very careful* with boolean arithmetic, especially
negation, in the presence of NA data. You may wish to add an explicit NA
filter into boolean array operations if you are worried about this:

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [4]: mask = series == ""Steve""

   In [5]: series[mask & series.notnull()]
   Out[5]:
   0    Steve
   Length: 1, dtype: object

While propagating NA in comparisons may seem like the right behavior to some
users (and you could argue on purely technical grounds that this is the right
thing to do), the evaluation was made that propagating NA everywhere, including
in numerical arrays, would cause a large amount of problems for users. Thus, a
""practicality beats purity"" approach was taken. This issue may be revisited at
some point in the future. Other API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When calling ``apply`` on a grouped Series, the return value will also be a
Series, to be more consistent with the ``groupby`` behavior with DataFrame:

.. code-block:: ipython

      In [6]: df = pd.DataFrame(
         ...:     {
         ...:         ""A"": [""foo"", ""bar"", ""foo"", ""bar"", ""foo"", ""bar"", ""foo"", ""foo""],
         ...:         ""B"": [""one"", ""one"", ""two"", ""three"", ""two"", ""two"", ""one"", ""three""],
         ...:         ""C"": np.random.randn(8),
         ...:         ""D"": np.random.randn(8),

Version 0.13.1 (February 3, 2014)
---------------------------------

{{ header }}



This is a minor release from 0.13.0 and includes a small number of API changes, several new features,
enhancements, and performance improvements along with a large number of bug fixes. We recommend that all
users upgrade to this version. Highlights include:

- Added ``infer_datetime_format`` keyword to ``read_csv/to_datetime`` to allow speedups for homogeneously formatted datetimes. - Will intelligently limit display precision for datetime/timedelta formats. - Enhanced Panel :meth:`~pandas.Panel.apply` method. - Suggested tutorials in new :ref:`Tutorials<tutorials>` section. - Our pandas ecosystem is growing, We now feature related projects in a new `ecosystem page <https://pandas.pydata.org/community/ecosystem.html>`_ section. - Much work has been taking place on improving the docs, and a new :ref:`Contributing<contributing>` section has been added. - Even though it may only be of interest to devs, we <3 our new CI status page: `ScatterCI <http://scatterci.github.io/pydata/pandas>`__. .. warning::

   0.13.1 fixes a bug that was caused by a combination of having numpy < 1.8, and doing
   chained assignment on a string-like array. Chained indexing can have unexpected results and should generally be avoided. This would previously segfault:

   .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df[""A""].iloc[0] = np.nan

   The recommended way to do this type of assignment is:

   .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df.loc[0, ""A""] = np.nan
      df

Output formatting enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- df.info() view now display dtype info per column (:issue:`5682`)

- df.info() now honors the option ``max_info_rows``, to disable null counts for large frames (:issue:`5974`)

  .. ipython:: python

     max_info_rows = pd.get_option(""max_info_rows"")

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         {
             ""A"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""B"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""C"": pd.date_range(""20130101"", periods=10),
         }
     )
     df.iloc[3:6, [0, 2]] = np.nan

  .. ipython:: python

     # set to not display the null counts
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", 0)
     df.info()

  .. ipython:: python

     # this is the default (same as in 0.13.0)
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", max_info_rows)
     df.info()

- Add ``show_dimensions`` display option for the new DataFrame repr to control whether the dimensions print. .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", False)
      df

      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", True)
      df

- The ``ArrayFormatter`` for ``datetime`` and ``timedelta64`` now intelligently
  limit precision based on the values in the array (:issue:`3401`)

  Previously output might look like:

  .. code-block:: text

        age                 today               diff
      0 2001-01-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 4491 days, 00:00:00
      1 2004-06-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 3244 days, 00:00:00

  Now the output looks like:

  .. ipython:: python

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         [pd.Timestamp(""20010101""), pd.Timestamp(""20040601"")], columns=[""age""]
     )
     df[""today""] = pd.Timestamp(""20130419"")
     df[""diff""] = df[""today""] - df[""age""]
     df

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``-NaN`` and ``-nan`` to the default set of NA values (:issue:`5952`). See :ref:`NA Values <io.na_values>`. - Added ``Series.str.get_dummies`` vectorized string method (:issue:`6021`), to extract
  dummy/indicator variables for separated string columns:

  .. ipython:: python

      s = pd.Series([""a"", ""a|b"", np.nan, ""a|c""])
      s.str.get_dummies(sep=""|"")

- Added the ``NDFrame.equals()`` method to compare if two NDFrames are
  equal have equal axes, dtypes, and values. Added the
  ``array_equivalent`` function to compare if two ndarrays are
  equal. NaNs in identical locations are treated as
  equal. (:issue:`5283`) See also :ref:`the docs<basics.equals>` for a motivating example. .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [""foo"", 0, np.nan]})
      df2 = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [np.nan, 0, ""foo""]}, index=[2, 1, 0])
      df.equals(df2)
      df.equals(df2.sort_index())

- ``DataFrame.apply`` will use the ``reduce`` argument to determine whether a
  ``Series`` or a ``DataFrame`` should be returned when the ``DataFrame`` is
  empty (:issue:`6007`). Previously, calling ``DataFrame.apply`` an empty ``DataFrame`` would return
  either a ``DataFrame`` if there were no columns, or the function being
  applied would be called with an empty ``Series`` to guess whether a
  ``Series`` or ``DataFrame`` should be returned:

  .. code-block:: ipython

    In [32]: def applied_func(col):
      ....:    print(""Apply function being called with: "", col)
      ....:    return col.sum()
      ....:

    In [33]: empty = DataFrame(columns=['a', 'b'])

    In [34]: empty.apply(applied_func)
    Apply function being called with:  Series([], Length: 0, dtype: float64)
    Out[34]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

  Now, when ``apply`` is called on an empty ``DataFrame``: if the ``reduce``
  argument is ``True`` a ``Series`` will returned, if it is ``False`` a
  ``DataFrame`` will be returned, and if it is ``None`` (the default) the
  function being applied will be called with an empty series to try and guess
  the return type. .. code-block:: ipython

    In [35]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=True)
    Out[35]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

    In [36]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=False)
    Out[36]:
    Empty DataFrame
    Columns: [a, b]
    Index: []

    [0 rows x 2 columns]

 [/INST] 

### Version Updates and Contributors

Version updates can significantly affect contributors in a project in several ways:

1. **Scope of Changes**: The updates may introduce new features, bug fixes, or improvements that can impact the functionality and user experience of the project. Contributors may need to review and test these changes to ensure they meet the project's standards and expectations.

2. **Integration with Other Libraries or Codebases**: Updates can sometimes require contributors to update dependencies or libraries used in the project. This can necessitate changes to the contributor's codebase, potentially requiring adjustments to the codebase's structure, API documentation, or even rewriting parts of the code.

3. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: With each version update, the project's test suite is typically updated to reflect the new changes. This means that contributors need to test the updated code and ensure that it works as expected, which can be time-consuming and may require additional testing efforts.

4. **Documentation and Documentation Updates**: Updates can also impact documentation, including user guides, API documentation, and any other documentation that may need to be updated to reflect the changes in the codebase.

5. **Community Feedback and Engagement**: The version update process often involves soliciting feedback from the community, which can lead to additional discussions, bug fixes, and enhancements based on community input.

6. **Changes in Licensing or Terms of Use**: Updates may also affect the licensing or terms of use, which can require contributors to review and adapt their contributions to comply with the new licensing conditions.

7. **Impact on Project Workflow and Productivity**: The changes can also affect how the project is managed, potentially impacting workflows, productivity, and overall project performance.

### Conclusion

Version updates can have a profound impact on contributors in a project, necessitating them to adapt their codebase, test, and documentation, and engage with the community in various ways. The changes can lead to improvements, enhancements, and bug fixes, while also affecting the project's workflow and overall productivity.

Version 0.7.3 (April 12, 2012)
------------------------------

{{ header }}


This is a minor release from 0.7.2 and fixes many minor bugs and adds a number
of nice new features. There are also a couple of API changes to note; these
should not affect very many users, and we are inclined to call them ""bug fixes""
even though they do constitute a change in behavior. See the :ref:`full release
notes <release>` or issue
tracker on GitHub for a complete list. New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New :ref:`fixed width file reader <io.fwf>`, ``read_fwf``
- New :ref:`scatter_matrix <visualization.scatter_matrix>` function for making
  a scatter plot matrix

.. code-block:: python

   from pandas.tools.plotting import scatter_matrix

   scatter_matrix(df, alpha=0.2)  # noqa F821


- Add ``stacked`` argument to Series and DataFrame's ``plot`` method for
  :ref:`stacked bar plots <visualization.barplot>`. .. code-block:: python

   df.plot(kind=""bar"", stacked=True)  # noqa F821


.. code-block:: python

   df.plot(kind=""barh"", stacked=True)  # noqa F821


- Add log x and y :ref:`scaling options <visualization.basic>` to
  ``DataFrame.plot`` and ``Series.plot``
- Add ``kurt`` methods to Series and DataFrame for computing kurtosis


NA boolean comparison API change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reverted some changes to how NA values (represented typically as ``NaN`` or
``None``) are handled in non-numeric Series:

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [1]: series = pd.Series([""Steve"", np.nan, ""Joe""])

   In [2]: series == ""Steve""
   Out[2]:
   0     True
   1    False
   2    False
   Length: 3, dtype: bool

   In [3]: series != ""Steve""
   Out[3]:
   0    False
   1     True
   2     True
   Length: 3, dtype: bool

In comparisons, NA / NaN will always come through as ``False`` except with
``!=`` which is ``True``. *Be very careful* with boolean arithmetic, especially
negation, in the presence of NA data. You may wish to add an explicit NA
filter into boolean array operations if you are worried about this:

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [4]: mask = series == ""Steve""

   In [5]: series[mask & series.notnull()]
   Out[5]:
   0    Steve
   Length: 1, dtype: object

While propagating NA in comparisons may seem like the right behavior to some
users (and you could argue on purely technical grounds that this is the right
thing to do), the evaluation was made that propagating NA everywhere, including
in numerical arrays, would cause a large amount of problems for users. Thus, a
""practicality beats purity"" approach was taken. This issue may be revisited at
some point in the future. Other API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When calling ``apply`` on a grouped Series, the return value will also be a
Series, to be more consistent with the ``groupby`` behavior with DataFrame:

.. code-block:: ipython

      In [6]: df = pd.DataFrame(
         ...:     {
         ...:         ""A"": [""foo"", ""bar"", ""foo"", ""bar"", ""foo"", ""bar"", ""foo"", ""foo""],
         ...:         ""B"": [""one"", ""one"", ""two"", ""three"", ""two"", ""two"", ""one"", ""three""],
         ...:         ""C"": np.random.randn(8),
         ...:         ""D"": np.random.randn(8),
         ...:     }
         ...: )
         ...:

      In [7]: df
      Out[7]:

Version 0.13.1 (February 3, 2014)
---------------------------------

{{ header }}



This is a minor release from 0.13.0 and includes a small number of API changes, several new features,
enhancements, and performance improvements along with a large number of bug fixes. We recommend that all
users upgrade to this version. Highlights include:

- Added ``infer_datetime_format`` keyword to ``read_csv/to_datetime`` to allow speedups for homogeneously formatted datetimes. - Will intelligently limit display precision for datetime/timedelta formats. - Enhanced Panel :meth:`~pandas.Panel.apply` method. - Suggested tutorials in new :ref:`Tutorials<tutorials>` section. - Our pandas ecosystem is growing, We now feature related projects in a new `ecosystem page <https://pandas.pydata.org/community/ecosystem.html>`_ section. - Much work has been taking place on improving the docs, and a new :ref:`Contributing<contributing>` section has been added. - Even though it may only be of interest to devs, we <3 our new CI status page: `ScatterCI <http://scatterci.github.io/pydata/pandas>`__. .. warning::

   0.13.1 fixes a bug that was caused by a combination of having numpy < 1.8, and doing
   chained assignment on a string-like array. Chained indexing can have unexpected results and should generally be avoided. This would previously segfault:

   .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df[""A""].iloc[0] = np.nan

   The recommended way to do this type of assignment is:

   .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df.loc[0, ""A""] = np.nan
      df

Output formatting enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- df.info() view now display dtype info per column (:issue:`5682`)

- df.info() now honors the option ``max_info_rows``, to disable null counts for large frames (:issue:`5974`)

  .. ipython:: python

     max_info_rows = pd.get_option(""max_info_rows"")

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         {
             ""A"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""B"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""C"": pd.date_range(""20130101"", periods=10),
         }
     )
     df.iloc[3:6, [0, 2]] = np.nan

  .. ipython:: python

     # set to not display the null counts
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", 0)
     df.info()

  .. ipython:: python

     # this is the default (same as in 0.13.0)
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", max_info_rows)
     df.info()

- Add ``show_dimensions`` display option for the new DataFrame repr to control whether the dimensions print. .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", False)
      df

      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", True)
      df

- The ``ArrayFormatter`` for ``datetime`` and ``timedelta64`` now intelligently
  limit precision based on the values in the array (:issue:`3401`)

  Previously output might look like:

  .. code-block:: text

        age                 today               diff
      0 2001-01-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 4491 days, 00:00:00
      1 2004-06-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 3244 days, 00:00:00

  Now the output looks like:

  .. ipython:: python

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         [pd.Timestamp(""20010101""), pd.Timestamp(""20040601"")], columns=[""age""]
     )
     df[""today""] = pd.Timestamp(""20130419"")
     df[""diff""] = df[""today""] - df[""age""]
     df

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``-NaN`` and ``-nan`` to the default set of NA values (:issue:`5952`). See :ref:`NA Values <io.na_values>`. - Added ``Series.str.get_dummies`` vectorized string method (:issue:`6021`), to extract
  dummy/indicator variables for separated string columns:

  .. ipython:: python

      s = pd.Series([""a"", ""a|b"", np.nan, ""a|c""])
      s.str.get_dummies(sep=""|"")

- Added the ``NDFrame.equals()`` method to compare if two NDFrames are
  equal have equal axes, dtypes, and values. Added the
  ``array_equivalent`` function to compare if two ndarrays are
  equal. NaNs in identical locations are treated as
  equal. (:issue:`5283`) See also :ref:`the docs<basics.equals>` for a motivating example. .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [""foo"", 0, np.nan]})
      df2 = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [np.nan, 0, ""foo""]}, index=[2, 1, 0])
      df.equals(df2)
      df.equals(df2.sort_index())

- ``DataFrame.apply`` will use the ``reduce`` argument to determine whether a
  ``Series`` or a ``DataFrame`` should be returned when the ``DataFrame`` is
  empty (:issue:`6007`). Previously, calling ``DataFrame.apply`` an empty ``DataFrame`` would return
  either a ``DataFrame`` if there were no columns, or the function being
  applied would be called with an empty ``Series`` to guess whether a
  ``Series`` or ``DataFrame`` should be returned:

  .. code-block:: ipython

    In [32]: def applied_func(col):
      ....:    print(""Apply function being called with: "", col)
      ....:    return col.sum()
      ....:

    In [33]: empty = DataFrame(columns=['a', 'b'])

    In [34]: empty.apply(applied_func)
    Apply function being called with:  Series([], Length: 0, dtype: float64)
    Out[34]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

  Now, when ``apply`` is called on an empty ``DataFrame``: if the ``reduce``
  argument is ``True`` a ``Series`` will returned, if it is ``False`` a
  ``DataFrame`` will be returned, and if it is ``None`` (the default) the
  function being applied will be called with an empty series to try and guess
  the return type. .. code-block:: ipython

    In [35]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=True)
    Out[35]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

    In [36]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=False)
    Out[36]:
    Empty DataFrame
    Columns: [a, b]
    Index: []

    [0 rows x 2 columns]

NA boolean comparison API change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reverted some changes to how NA values (represented typically as ``NaN`` or
``None``) are handled in non-numeric Series:

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [1]: series = pd.Series([""Steve"", np.nan, ""Joe""])

   In [2]: series == ""Steve""
   Out[2]:
   0     True
   1    False
   2    False
   Length: 3, dtype: bool

   In [3]: series != ""Steve""
   Out[3]:
   0    False
   1     True
   2     True
   Length: 3, dtype: bool

In comparisons, NA / NaN will always come through as ``False`` except with
``!=`` which is ``True``. *Be very careful* with boolean arithmetic, especially
negation, in the presence of NA data. You may wish to add an explicit NA
filter into boolean array operations if you are worried about this:

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [4]: mask = series == ""Steve""

   0    Steve
   Length: 1, dtype: object

While propagating NA in comparisons may seem like the right behavior to some
users (and you could argue on purely technical grounds that this is the right
thing to do), the evaluation was made that propagating NA everywhere, including

Version 0.13.1 (February 3, 2014)
---------------------------------

{{ header }}



This is a minor release from 0.13.0 and includes a small number of API changes, several new features,
enhancements, and performance improvements along with a large number of bug fixes. We recommend that all
users upgrade to this version. Highlights include:

- Added ``infer_datetime_format`` keyword to ``read_csv/to_datetime`` to allow speedups for homogeneously formatted datetimes. - Will intelligently limit display precision for datetime/timedelta formats. - Enhanced Panel :meth:`~pandas.Panel.apply` method. - Suggested tutorials in new :ref:`Tutorials<tutorials>` section. - Our pandas ecosystem is growing, We now feature related projects in a new `ecosystem page <https://pandas.pydata.org/community/ecosystem.html>`_ section. - Much work has been taking place on improving the docs, and a new :ref:`Contributing<contributing>` section has been added. - Even though it may only be of interest to devs, we <3 our new CI status page: `ScatterCI <http://scatterci.github.io/pydata/pandas>`__. .. warning::

   0.13.1 fixes a bug that was caused by a combination of having numpy < 1.8, and doing
   chained assignment on a string-like array. Chained indexing can have unexpected results and should generally be avoided. This would previously segfault:

   .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df[""A""].iloc[0] = np.nan

   The recommended way to do this type of assignment is:

   .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df.loc[0, ""A""] = np.nan
      df

Output formatting enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- df.info() view now display dtype info per column (:issue:`5682`)

- df.info() now honors the option ``max_info_rows``, to disable null counts for large frames (:issue:`5974`)

  .. ipython:: python

     max_info_rows = pd.get_option(""max_info_rows"")

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         {
             ""A"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""B"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""C"": pd.date_range(""20130101"", periods=10),
         }
     )
     df.iloc[3:6, [0, 2]] = np.nan

  .. ipython:: python

     # set to not display the null counts
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", 0)
     df.info()

  .. ipython:: python

     # this is the default (same as in 0.13.0)
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", max_info_rows)
     df.info()

- Add ``show_dimensions`` display option for the new DataFrame repr to control whether the dimensions print. .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", False)
      df

      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", True)
      df

- The ``ArrayFormatter`` for ``datetime`` and ``timedelta64`` now intelligently
  limit precision based on the values in the array (:issue:`3401`)

  Previously output might look like:

  .. code-block:: text

        age                 today               diff
      0 2001-01-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 4491 days, 00:00:00
      1 2004-06-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 3244 days, 00:00:00

  Now the output looks like:

  .. ipython:: python

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         [pd.Timestamp(""20010101""), pd.Timestamp(""20040601"")], columns=[""age""]
     )
     df[""today""] = pd.Timestamp(""20130419"")
     df[""diff""] = df[""today""] - df[""age""]
     df

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``-NaN`` and ``-nan`` to the default set of NA values (:issue:`5952`). See :ref:`NA Values <io.na_values>`. - Added ``Series.str.get_dummies`` vectorized string method (:issue:`6021`), to extract
  dummy/indicator variables for separated string columns:

  .. ipython:: python

      s = pd.Series([""a"", ""a|b"", np.nan, ""a|c""])
      s.str.get_dummies(sep=""|"")

- Added the ``NDFrame.equals()`` method to compare if two NDFrames are
  equal have equal axes, dtypes, and values. Added the
  ``array_equivalent`` function to compare if two ndarrays are
  equal. NaNs in identical locations are treated as
  equal. (:issue:`5283`) See also :ref:`the docs<basics.equals>` for a motivating example. .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [""foo"", 0, np.nan]})
      df2 = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [np.nan, 0, ""foo""]}, index=[2, 1, 0])
      df.equals(df2)
      df.equals(df2.sort_index())

- ``DataFrame.apply`` will use the ``reduce`` argument to determine whether a
  ``Series`` or a ``DataFrame`` should be returned when the ``DataFrame`` is
  empty (:issue:`6007`). Previously, calling ``DataFrame.apply`` an empty ``DataFrame`` would return
  either a ``DataFrame`` if there were no columns, or the function being
  applied would be called with an empty ``Series`` to guess whether a
  ``Series`` or ``DataFrame`` should be returned:

  .. code-block:: ipython

    In [32]: def applied_func(col):
      ....:    print(""Apply function being called with: "", col)
      ....:    return col.sum()
      ....:

    In [33]: empty = DataFrame(columns=['a', 'b'])

    In [34]: empty.apply(applied_func)
    Apply function being called with:  Series([], Length: 0, dtype: float64)
    Out[34]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

  Now, when ``apply`` is called on an empty ``DataFrame``: if the ``reduce``
  argument is ``True`` a ``Series`` will returned, if it is ``False`` a
  ``DataFrame`` will be returned, and if it is ``None`` (the default) the
  function being applied will be called with an empty series to try and guess
  the return type. .. code-block:: ipython

    In [35]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=True)
    Out[35]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

    In [36]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=False)
    Out[36]:
    Empty DataFrame
    Columns: [a, b]
    Index: []

    [0 rows x 2 columns]

Version 0.7.3 (April 12, 2012)
------------------------------

{{ header }}


This is a minor release from 0.7.2 and fixes many minor bugs and adds a number
of nice new features. There are also a couple of API changes to note; these
should not affect very many users, and we are inclined to call them ""bug fixes""
even though they do constitute a change in behavior. See the :ref:`full release
notes <release>` or issue
tracker on GitHub for a complete list. New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New :ref:`fixed width file reader <io.fwf>`, ``read_fwf``
- New :ref:`scatter_matrix <visualization.scatter_matrix>` function for making
  a scatter plot matrix

.. code-block:: python

   from pandas.tools.plotting import scatter_matrix

   scatter_matrix(df, alpha=0.2)  # noqa F821


- Add ``stacked`` argument to Series and DataFrame's ``plot`` method for
  :ref:`stacked bar plots <visualization.barplot>`. .. code-block:: python

   df.plot(kind=""bar"", stacked=True)  # noqa F821


.. code-block:: python

   df.plot(kind=""barh"", stacked=True)  # noqa F821


- Add log x and y :ref:`scaling options <visualization.basic>` to
  ``DataFrame.plot`` and ``Series.plot``
- Add ``kurt`` methods to Series and DataFrame for computing kurtosis


NA boolean comparison API change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reverted some changes to how NA values (represented typically as ``NaN`` or
``None``) are handled in non-numeric Series:

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [1]: series = pd.Series([""Steve"", np.nan, ""Joe""])

   In [2]: series == ""Steve""
   Out[2]:
   0     True
   1    False
   2    False
   Length: 3, dtype: bool

   In [3]: series != ""Steve""
   Out[3]:
   0    False
   1     True
   2     True
   Length: 3, dtype: bool

In comparisons, NA / NaN will always come through as ``False`` except with
``!=`` which is ``True``. *Be very careful* with boolean arithmetic, especially
negation, in the presence of NA data. You may wish to add an explicit NA
filter into boolean array operations if you are worried about this:

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [4]: mask = series == ""Steve""

   In [5]: series[mask & series.notnull()]
   Out[5]:
   0    Steve
   Length: 1, dtype: object

While propagating NA in comparisons may seem like the right behavior to some
users (and you could argue on purely technical grounds that this is the right
thing to do), the evaluation was made that propagating NA everywhere, including
in numerical arrays, would cause a large amount of problems for users. Thus, a
""practicality beats purity"" approach was taken. This issue may be revisited at
some point in the future. Other API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When calling ``apply`` on a grouped Series, the return value will also be a
Series, to be more consistent with the ``groupby`` behavior with DataFrame:

.. code-block:: ipython

      In [6]: df = pd.DataFrame(
         ...:     {
         ...:         ""A"": [""foo"", ""bar"", ""foo"", ""bar"", ""foo"", ""bar"", ""foo"", ""foo""],
         ...:         ""B"": [""one"", ""one"", ""two"", ""three"", ""two"", ""two"", ""one"", ""three""],
         ...:         ""C"": np.random.randn(8),
         ...:         ""D"": np.random.randn(8),
         ...:     }
         ...: )
         ...:

Version 0.13.1 (February 3, 2014)
---------------------------------

{{ header }}



This is a minor release from 0.13.0 and includes a small number of API changes, several new features,
enhancements, and performance improvements along with a large number of bug fixes. We recommend that all
users upgrade to this version. Highlights include:

- Added ``infer_datetime_format`` keyword to ``read_csv/to_datetime`` to allow speedups for homogeneously formatted datetimes. - Will intelligently limit display precision for datetime/timedelta formats. - Enhanced Panel :meth:`~pandas.Panel.apply` method. - Suggested tutorials in new :ref:`Tutorials<tutorials>` section. - Our pandas ecosystem is growing, We now feature related projects in a new `ecosystem page <https://pandas.pydata.org/community/ecosystem.html>`_ section. - Much work has been taking place on improving the docs, and a new :ref:`Contributing<contributing>` section has been added. - Even though it may only be of interest to devs, we <3 our new CI status page: `ScatterCI <http://scatterci.github.io/pydata/pandas>`__. .. warning::

   0.13.1 fixes a bug that was caused by a combination of having numpy < 1.8, and doing
   chained assignment on a string-like array. Chained indexing can have unexpected results and should generally be avoided. This would previously segfault:

   .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df[""A""].iloc[0] = np.nan

   The recommended way to do this type of assignment is:

   .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": np.array([""foo"", ""bar"", ""bah"", ""foo"", ""bar""])})
      df.loc[0, ""A""] = np.nan
      df

Output formatting enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- df.info() view now display dtype info per column (:issue:`5682`)

- df.info() now honors the option ``max_info_rows``, to disable null counts for large frames (:issue:`5974`)

  .. ipython:: python

     max_info_rows = pd.get_option(""max_info_rows"")

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         {
             ""A"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""B"": np.random.randn(10),
             ""C"": pd.date_range(""20130101"", periods=10),
         }
     )
     df.iloc[3:6, [0, 2]] = np.nan

  .. ipython:: python

     # set to not display the null counts
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", 0)
     df.info()

  .. ipython:: python

     # this is the default (same as in 0.13.0)
     pd.set_option(""max_info_rows"", max_info_rows)
     df.info()

- Add ``show_dimensions`` display option for the new DataFrame repr to control whether the dimensions print. .. ipython:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", False)
      df

      pd.set_option(""show_dimensions"", True)
      df

- The ``ArrayFormatter`` for ``datetime`` and ``timedelta64`` now intelligently
  limit precision based on the values in the array (:issue:`3401`)

  Previously output might look like:

  .. code-block:: text

        age                 today               diff
      0 2001-01-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 4491 days, 00:00:00
      1 2004-06-01 00:00:00 2013-04-19 00:00:00 3244 days, 00:00:00

  Now the output looks like:

  .. ipython:: python

     df = pd.DataFrame(
         [pd.Timestamp(""20010101""), pd.Timestamp(""20040601"")], columns=[""age""]
     )
     df[""today""] = pd.Timestamp(""20130419"")
     df[""diff""] = df[""today""] - df[""age""]
     df

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add ``-NaN`` and ``-nan`` to the default set of NA values (:issue:`5952`). See :ref:`NA Values <io.na_values>`. - Added ``Series.str.get_dummies`` vectorized string method (:issue:`6021`), to extract
  dummy/indicator variables for separated string columns:

  .. ipython:: python

      s = pd.Series([""a"", ""a|b"", np.nan, ""a|c""])
      s.str.get_dummies(sep=""|"")

- Added the ``NDFrame.equals()`` method to compare if two NDFrames are
  equal have equal axes, dtypes, and values. Added the
  ``array_equivalent`` function to compare if two ndarrays are
  equal. NaNs in identical locations are treated as
  equal. (:issue:`5283`) See also :ref:`the docs<basics.equals>` for a motivating example. .. code-block:: python

      df = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [""foo"", 0, np.nan]})
      df2 = pd.DataFrame({""col"": [np.nan, 0, ""foo""]}, index=[2, 1, 0])
      df.equals(df2)
      df.equals(df2.sort_index())

- ``DataFrame.apply`` will use the ``reduce`` argument to determine whether a
  ``Series`` or a ``DataFrame`` should be returned when the ``DataFrame`` is
  empty (:issue:`6007`). Previously, calling ``DataFrame.apply`` an empty ``DataFrame`` would return
  either a ``DataFrame`` if there were no columns, or the function being
  applied would be called with an empty ``Series`` to guess whether a
  ``Series`` or ``DataFrame`` should be returned:

  .. code-block:: ipython

    In [32]: def applied_func(col):
      ....:    print(""Apply function being called with: "", col)
      ....:    return col.sum()
      ....:

    In [33]: empty = DataFrame(columns=['a', 'b'])

    In [34]: empty.apply(applied_func)
    Apply function being called with:  Series([], Length: 0, dtype: float64)
    Out[34]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

  Now, when ``apply`` is called on an empty ``DataFrame``: if the ``reduce``
  argument is ``True`` a ``Series`` will returned, if it is ``False`` a
  ``DataFrame`` will be returned, and if it is ``None`` (the default) the
  function being applied will be called with an empty series to try and guess
  the return type. .. code-block:: ipython

    In [35]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=True)
    Out[35]:
    a   NaN
    b   NaN
    Length: 2, dtype: float64

    In [36]: empty.apply(applied_func, reduce=False)
    Out[36]:
    Empty DataFrame
    Columns: [a, b]
    Index: []

    [0 rows x 2 columns]


Prior version deprecations/changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no announced changes in 0.13 or prior that are taking effect as of 0.13.1

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no deprecations of prior behavior in 0.13.1

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``pd.read_csv`` and ``pd.to_datetime`` learned a new ``infer_datetime_format`` keyword which greatly
  improves parsing perf in many cases. Thanks to @lexual for suggesting and @danbirken
  for rapidly implementing.

### Answer

The purpose of the method that applies a rule to a series of dates is to perform a specific operation on the dates, such as flooring, ceiling, rounding, etc. It allows users to define a rule to transform the dates in the series before processing them further. This method is commonly used in data analysis and manipulation tasks, such as data cleaning or data transformation, where dates need to be converted or formatted in a particular way.

### Key Points

- The method can be applied directly to a DatetimeIndex or a Series with datetime values.
- The returned result is a new DatetimeIndex or a Series with the same name as the original data.
- The method applies the specified rule to each date in the series.
- The rule can be set using various methods such as floor, ceil, round.
- Contexts can provide additional information about the specific use case and the desired output of the method.

### Additional Use Cases

- **Flooring**: Use this method to round down dates to a specific frequency.
- **Ceiling**: Use to raise dates to a specific frequency.
- **Round**: Use to round dates to a specific precision.
- **Examples**: Can be used to clean or format dates in a dataset.
- **Use it only when it is helpful**: Use the method in contexts where the time is not relevant, or the result needs to be a DatetimeIndex or Series.

### Conclusion

The method for applying a rule to a series of dates is a versatile tool in data manipulation, allowing users to perform specific operations on the dates in a series and return the results in a new format or maintain the original structure. Its application depends on the context and the desired outcome.","<s>[INST] What is the purpose of the method that applies a rule to a series of dates?

The method that applies a rule to a series of dates can be used to filter the dates, calculate new dates, or modify existing date values. It can also be used to enforce business rules, for example, by converting dates from one format to another or by applying date-based calculations. The specific use case depends on the needs of the data processing pipeline or application. 

### Example Use Case:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = {
    'dates': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-02', '2022-01-03', '2022-01-04', '2022-01-05'}
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Method to apply a rule: convert dates to string format
def convert_date_format(date):
    return date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

# Apply the method to the 'dates' column
df['dates'] = df['dates'].apply(convert_date_format)

print(df)
```

### Output:

```
   dates
0  2022-01-01
1  2022-01-02
2  2022-01-03
3  2022-01-04
4  2022-01-05
