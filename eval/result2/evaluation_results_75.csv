","<s>[INST] How does the validate_indices function handle the value -1?
 [/INST] 

The answer is:

The `validate_indices` function is designed to validate the indices of an array-like object, and it does not explicitly handle the value -1. If you pass -1 as an index, it will raise an error or return an error message, indicating that the index is invalid. If you pass a valid index, the function will return the corresponding element from the array. 

In the context of the provided code snippet, the `validate_indices` function is likely used in a data processing context, where the index is used to access elements from a list or array. If the index is -1, it may be a valid index for certain operations, but it may not be for others, and the function should be used with caution. 

Example:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3]
indices = [0, -1, 4]

result = validate_indices(arr, indices)
print(result[0])  # Output: 1
print(result[-1])  # Output: 3
print(result[-1])  # Output: 3 (because -1 is valid in this case)
``` 

In this example, -1 is valid and is returned as the last element of the resulting array. If you were to pass -1 as the first index, it would raise an error. 

Note: The actual implementation of the `validate_indices` function may vary depending on the specific context and requirements. This is just a general interpretation based on the provided snippet. 

If you need more information or context about the specific `validate_indices` function, please provide more details. 

The best answer is: 
The `validate_indices` function is designed to handle valid indices and invalid ones, and -1 is considered a valid index in certain contexts. If you pass -1, it will be handled appropriately. If you pass a valid index, it will return the corresponding element. 

Example:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3]
indices = [0, -1, 4]

result = validate_indices(arr, indices)
print(result[0])  # Output: 1
print(result[-1])  # Output: 3
print(result[-1])  # Output: 3 (because -1 is valid in this case)
```

In this example, -1 is valid and is returned as the last element of the resulting array. If you were to pass -1 as the first index, it would raise an error.

 [/INST] 

The `validate_indices` function is designed to handle the value -1 when indexing an array-like object. In the context of the provided functions, the behavior is clear: -1 is an acceptable value for the `n` parameter, indicating that the index is missing or undefined. 

In the first context, the function is used to check if a typed bound is an integer. In this case, -1 is valid since it falls within the allowed range of valid integer values (0 to 2).

In the second context, the function is part of a more general method for validating the bounds of an indexer in a multi-index. The behavior remains consistent, as -1 is not an invalid value in this context.

In the third context, the function is used to check the level of an index. Since it's a single-level index, -1 is valid as it does not pose any problems.

In the fourth context, the function is used to create a new object with a valid index. The behavior is consistent with the others, where -1 is acceptable.

In the fifth context, the function is used to ensure that an index is created if it does not exist. Again, -1 is valid in this case, as it does not represent an invalid index.

Overall, the `validate_indices` function provides a clear and consistent way to handle the value -1 when working with index bounds, ensuring that it is treated as a valid and acceptable input.","<s>[INST] How does the validate_indices function handle the value -1?

### How does the `validate_indices` function handle the value -1?

The `validate_indices` function in the provided context does not explicitly handle the value -1. It is used as a placeholder for a valid index value, which is typically an integer. In the given contexts, -1 is used to indicate that the index is missing or out of bounds. 

### Considerations

- In the first context, it is used in the function to check if the indexed value has a valid bounds.
- In the second context, it is used in the method to check if the index is properly set.
- In the third context, it is used in the function to validate the index level.
- In the fourth context, it is used to create a new index object with a valid index value.
- In the fifth context, it is used to ensure that an index is created if it does not exist.

### Conclusion

The value -1 is handled as a valid index in the given contexts because it represents an absence of bounds or a missing index, which is a common interpretation in indexing contexts. The function's intent is to validate the index's existence and bounds, and -1 is used to convey that absence. 

### Additional Contexts

If you would like to consider other scenarios or additional contexts, please specify them. Otherwise, the explanation provided covers the main handling of the value -1 in the provided examples.

 [/INST] 

I've been using the validate_indices function to validate a dataframe, and I'm wondering how it handles the value -1. If I pass a value -1 to validate_indices, I get a ValueError.

My dataframe is like this:

    A    B
0  1  2
1  3  4
2  5  6
3  7  8
4  9  10
5 10 11

I want to validate that A = -1 is not valid for any row, but I get a ValueError when I pass -1 to validate_indices. I'm using this code:

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [-1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                 'B': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]})

validate_indices(df)

This code should return True for all rows except row 0, but it gives a ValueError. I'm not sure what's going wrong. 

Is there a way to handle the -1 value correctly? I've tried setting a default value to -1 in the validate_indices function, but that doesn't seem to work.

Here's my code:

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [-1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                 'B': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]})

validate_indices(df, default=-1)

This code doesn't give a ValueError, but it also doesn't validate -1 correctly. I'm not sure what's going on.

Here's my code:
def validate_indices(df, default=None, func=None, validate_func=None):
    """"""
    Validate a list of values against a list of valid values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : DataFrame, Series, or Index
        The input data to validate.
    default : any, default None
        The value to return if the input data is not valid.
    func : callable, default None
        A function to apply to each value in the input data.
        If None, no validation will be performed.
    validate_func : callable, default None
        A function to validate the output of func.
        If None, no validation will be performed.
    """"""
    if validate_func is None:
        validate_func = lambda x: True
    if func is None:
        validate_func = lambda x: True

    def validate(x):
        if validate_func is not None:
            return validate_func(x)
        return x

    if default is not None:
        validate(df.apply(validate, args=(df, default)))

    return validate(df.apply(validate, args=(df, validate_func)))

validate_indices(df)

This code returns True for all rows, except row 0, but it doesn't validate -1 correctly.

","<s>[INST] What parameter does the validate_indices function take to determine the valid range for indices?
 [/INST] 

The `validate_indices` function is used to validate the indices provided against a specific range. It typically takes two parameters: the first parameter is the data to be indexed, and the second parameter is the valid range of indices within which the data is supposed to be indexed. The function can return an error message if the indices are out of range or if they do not match the expected values. 

The function can be implemented to handle different types of data, such as lists, arrays, or even custom data types. 

### Example Usage:

```python
import numpy as np

def validate_indices(data, valid_range):
    """"""
    Validate the indices of a given data set against a specific range.

    Args:
        data (list or array): The data to be indexed.
        valid_range (tuple): A tuple representing the valid range for indices.

    Returns:
        str: An error message if the indices are out of range or do not match the expected values.
    """"""
    if not isinstance(data, (list, np.ndarray)):
        raise TypeError(""The input data must be a list or a numpy array."")
    if not isinstance(valid_range, tuple) or len(valid_range)!= 2:
        raise ValueError(""The valid range must be a tuple with two elements."")

    try:
        start, end = valid_range
        # Check if the indices are within the range
        if start < 0 or end > len(data):
            return f""Indices out of range: {start} or {end}""
        # Check if the indices match the expected values
        if data[range(start):range(end+1)].tolist()!= valid_range:
            return f""Indices do not match the expected values: {data[range(start):range(end+1)].tolist()}""
    except Exception as e:
        return f""An error occurred: {str(e)}""

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
valid_range = (0, 2)
print(validate_indices(numbers, valid_range))  # Should print no error message

# Example with invalid indices
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
try:
    print(validate_indices(numbers, (1, 3)))  # Should print error message
except Exception as e:
    print(e)  # Should print the error message

# Example with out of range indices
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
try:
    print(validate_indices(numbers, (-1, 3)))  # Should print error message
except Exception as e:
    print(e)  # Should print the error message
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `validate_indices` function with different types of data and different ranges, as well as how it handles invalid or out-of-range indices. The function provides clear documentation and example usage, making it easy to understand its purpose and usage.","<s>[INST] What parameter does the validate_indices function take to determine the valid range for indices?
 [/INST] 

 The function `validate_indices` can take a parameter called `bounds` which defines the valid range for the indices. This parameter can be an array of two elements that specify the lower and upper bounds of the indices. If the provided indices are outside this range, the function will return an error.

### Example Usage:

```python
def validate_indices(indices, bounds=(0, 10)):
    if not isinstance(indices, list) or len(indices)!= 2:
        raise ValueError(""Indices must be a list of two elements"")
    if bounds[0] > bounds[1]:
        raise ValueError(""Upper bound must be less than or equal to lower bound"")
    return indices within bounds

# Example usage:
indices = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
bounds = (0, 10)
print(validate_indices(indices, bounds))  # Valid indices
print(validate_indices([11, 2, 3], bounds))  # Error: Upper bound exceeds lower bound
```

### Explanation:

1. The `validate_indices` function takes an optional `bounds` parameter, which defaults to `(0, 10)` if not provided. This parameter defines the valid range for the input indices.
2. It checks if the `indices` provided is a list and has exactly two elements. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.
3. It then checks if the upper bound of the `bounds` is less than or equal to the lower bound. If this condition is not met, it raises another `ValueError`.
4. The function returns `True` if all indices are within the defined range, and `False` otherwise.

This function can be used to validate the indices of a list or other iterable to ensure they fall within a specified range.","{'overall_score': 7, 'overall_rationale': 'The answer provides a reasonable explanation of what parameters the `validate_indices` function takes, with an example of implementation.

### Parameter to determine the valid range for indices

The `validate_indices` function typically takes a parameter that determines the valid range for indices. This parameter is usually an integer that specifies the upper bound of the valid indices. If the function is called with a range, it will return the index at the specified range. Otherwise, it will raise an error or return None.

### Example Usage

In the context of the `validate_indices` function, an example would look like this:

```python
def validate_indices(indices, n):
    if n == 1:
        # Range of valid indices
        return indices[:5]
    else:
        raise ValueError(""n must be 1 for this function"")
```

### Conclusion

In summary, the parameter to determine the valid range for indices in the `validate_indices` function is an integer that specifies the upper bound of the valid indices. If the function is called with a range, it will return the index at that range. Otherwise, it will raise an error. Contexts can be found in various applications where this function is used, such as data processing or data analysis.","<s>[INST] What parameter does the validate_indices function take to determine the valid range for indices?

### Parameters of `validate_indices` function
1. `indices`: The valid range of indices to check.
2. `n`: A boolean indicating whether to use the last valid index or the first valid index.

### Contexts
1. In the `validate_indices` function, the parameter `indices` is used to define the valid range for the indices. This range can be specified as a tuple or a list of indices. The function then checks if the provided indices fall within this valid range. If they do, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. In the `find_valid_index` function, `is_valid` is used as a parameter to filter the indices to find the first valid index. The function can take either `first` or `last` as an argument, which determines whether to consider the first or last valid index.

3. In the `first_valid_index` function, `position` is used as a parameter to retrieve the first valid index. The function can return `None` if no valid index is found.

4. In the `DataFrame.last_valid_index` function, `last_valid_index` is used to get the last valid index of a DataFrame. The function can return `None` if no valid index is found.

5. In the `isna` function, `na` is used as a parameter to detect missing values. The function can return `None` if no non-NA value is found.

6. In the `DataFrame.last_valid_index` function, `last_valid_index` is used to get the last valid index of a DataFrame. The function can return `None` if no non-NA value is found.

7. In the `DataFrame.isna` function, `isna` is used as a parameter to detect missing values. The function can return `None` if no non-NA value is found.

8. In the `_validate_index_level` function, `level` is used as a parameter to validate the index level. The function can return `None` if the level is not an integer.

9. In the `_validate_indexer` function, `form`, `key`, and `kind` are used as parameters to validate the index. The function can return `None` if any of these parameters are not of the expected type.

### Example use case
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
data = {'A': [1, 2, 3]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Use validate_indices function
valid_range = (0, 2)
indices = df[valid_range]
print(df[indices])  # Returns a DataFrame with only index 0 and 1

# Use find_valid_index function
is_valid = True
find_valid_index(1)
print(find_valid_index(1))  # Returns 1

# Use last_valid_index function
last_valid_index = df.last_valid_index()
print(last_valid_index)  # Returns 2

# Use isna function
isna_value = pd.Series([None, None])
print(isna_value)  # Returns None
```

*************************
Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.
Context 2: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

************************
Intro to data structures
************************

We'll start with a quick, non-comprehensive overview of the fundamental data
structures in pandas to get you started. The fundamental behavior about data
types, indexing, axis labeling, and alignment apply across all of the
objects. To get started, import NumPy and load pandas into your namespace:

.. ipython:: python

   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd

Fundamentally, **data alignment is intrinsic**. The link
between labels and data will not be broken unless done so explicitly by you.
Context 4: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.
Context 5: A pandas ``DataFrame`` can be constructed in many different ways,
but for a small number of values, it is often convenient to specify it as
a Python dictionary, where the keys are the column names
and the values are the data. ..

 [/INST] 

### Primary Data Structures Offered by Pandas
Pandas is a powerful library in Python for data manipulation and analysis. It offers several primary data structures that can be used to store and manipulate data. The most common ones include:

1. **Series (1-dimensional labeled array)**:
   - **Characteristic**: A single column of data, where each element is a value.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Can have any number of columns.
     - Can have any number of rows.
     - Can contain any type of data (numeric, string, datetime, etc.).
   - **Example**: `pd.Series('Hello, World!'`

2. **DataFrame (2-dimensional labeled data structure)**:
   - **Characteristic**: A tabular data structure with columns of potentially different types and rows of the same type.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Can have any number of columns.
     - Can have any number of rows.
     - Can contain any type of data (numeric, string, datetime, etc.).
   - **Example**: `pd.DataFrame({'Name': ['John', 'Anna', 'Peter'], 'Age': [28, 24, 35]})`

3. **Index (1-dimensional labeled array of indices)**:
   - **Characteristic**: A collection of labels that uniquely identify the rows and columns of a DataFrame.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Can be created from a Series.
     - Can be used to label the DataFrame.
   - **Example**: `pd.Index(['A', 'B', 'C'])`

4. **MultiIndex (2-dimensional labeled array of indices)**:
   - **Characteristic**: A collection of labels that uniquely identify the rows and columns of a DataFrame, including a secondary index.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Can be created from a Series.
     - Can be used to label the DataFrame.
   - **Example**: `pd.MultiIndex(['A', 'B', 'C', pd.Index(['x', 'y', 'z'])]`

### Conclusion
Pandas offers a variety of data structures that cater to different data manipulation needs. The choice of data structure depends on the type of data, the nature of the analysis, and the desired level of flexibility and ease of use. Each data structure provides unique characteristics that can enhance data manipulation and analysis capabilities in Python. 

### Example Usage
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a Series
s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3])

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'Name': ['John', 'Anna', 'Peter'], 'Age': [28, 24, 35]})

# Create an Index
index = pd.Index(['A', 'B', 'C'])

# Create a MultiIndex
multi_index = pd.MultiIndex([('x', 'y'), ('z', 'w')])

# Concatenate DataFrames
df_concat = pd.concat([s, df], axis=1)
df_concat = pd.concat([s, multi_index], axis=1)

print(s)
print(df)
print(index)
print(multi_index)
print(df_concat)
```

*************************
Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.
Context 2: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

Intro to data structures
************************

We'll start with a quick, non-comprehensive overview of the fundamental data
structures in pandas to get you started. The fundamental behavior about data
types, indexing, axis labeling, and alignment apply across all of the
objects. To get started, import NumPy and load pandas into your namespace:

.. ipython:: python

   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd

Fundamentally, **data alignment is intrinsic**. The link
between labels and data will not be broken unless done so explicitly by you.
Context 4: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.
Context 5: A pandas ``DataFrame`` can be constructed in many different ways,
but for a small number of values, it is often convenient to specify it as
a Python dictionary, where the keys are the column names
and the values are the data. ..

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.
Context 2: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support
---------------

The first stop for pandas issues and ideas is the `GitHub Issue Tracker
<https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues>`__. If you have a general question,
pandas community experts can answer through `Stack Overflow
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas>`__. Community
---------

pandas is actively supported today by a community of like-minded individuals around
the world who contribute their valuable time and energy to help make open source
pandas possible. Thanks to `all of our contributors <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/graphs/contributors>`__. If you're interested in contributing, please visit the :ref:`contributing guide <contributing>`. pandas is a `NumFOCUS <https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects>`__ sponsored project. This will help ensure the success of the development of pandas as a world-class open-source
project and makes it possible to `donate <https://pandas.pydata.org/donate.html>`__ to the project. Project governance
------------------

The governance process that pandas project has used informally since its inception in 2008 is formalized in `Project Governance documents <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/web/pandas/about/governance.md>`__. The documents clarify how decisions are made and how the various elements of our community interact, including the relationship between open source collaborative development and work that may be funded by for-profit or non-profit entities.

Intro to data structures
************************

We'll start with a quick, non-comprehensive overview of the fundamental data
structures in pandas to get you started. The fundamental behavior about data
types, indexing, axis labeling, and alignment apply across all of the
objects. To get started, import NumPy and load pandas into your namespace:

.. ipython:: python

   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd

Fundamentally, **data alignment is intrinsic**. The link
between labels and data will not be broken unless done so explicitly by you.
Context 4: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.
Context 5: A pandas ``DataFrame`` can be constructed in many different ways,
but for a small number of values, it is often convenient to specify it as
a Python dictionary, where the keys are the column names
and the values are the data. ..

Context 1: .. _scale:

*************************
Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.
Context 2: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

Intro to data structures
************************

We'll start with a quick, non-comprehensive overview of the fundamental data
structures in pandas to get you started. The fundamental behavior about data
types, indexing, axis labeling, and alignment apply across all of the
objects. To get started, import NumPy and load pandas into your namespace:

.. ipython:: python

   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd

Fundamentally, **data alignment is intrinsic**. The link
between labels and data will not be broken unless done so explicitly by you.
Context 4: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.
Context 5: A pandas ``DataFrame`` can be constructed in many different ways,
but for a small number of values, it is often convenient to specify it as
a Python dictionary, where the keys are the column names
and the values are the data. ..

*************************
Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option

   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its

Different choices for indexing
------------------------------

Object selection has had a number of user-requested additions in order to
support more explicit location based indexing. pandas now supports three types
of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*
  semantics).
Context 5: A pandas ``DataFrame`` can be constructed in many different ways,
but for a small number of values, it is often convenient to specify it as
a Python dictionary, where the keys are the column names
and the values are the data. ..

 [/INST] 

### 1. **Data Organization**
   - **Benefits of different data structures:**
     - **Flexibility:** You can use different data structures to represent data that has varying properties (e.g., different types of data or multiple columns). 
     - **Simplification:** Using multiple data structures can help in organizing data in a way that makes it easier to understand and manipulate.

### 2. **Efficient Storage and Retrieval**
   - **Benefits of different data structures:**
     - **Storage Efficiency:** Different data structures can be optimized for specific types of data, such as memory usage or data manipulation speed. For example, using a dictionary for key-value pairs can be more efficient than a list for large datasets.
     - **Retrieval Speed:** Choosing the appropriate data structure can significantly improve the speed of data retrieval, especially when dealing with large datasets.

### 3. **Data Manipulation and Analysis**
   - **Benefits of different data structures:**
     - **Data Manipulation:** Different data structures can be more suitable for different types of operations. For example, using a list can be more efficient for operations that require frequent append or indexing, while using a dictionary can be more convenient for lookups.
     - **Data Analysis:** The choice of data structure can also influence the ease of data analysis, such as grouping, aggregating, or sorting data.

### 4. **Scalability and Performance**
   - **Benefits of different data structures:**
     - **Scalability:** Choosing the right data structure can ensure the data structure can handle large amounts of data without compromising performance.
     - **Performance:** The choice of data structure can impact the performance of operations, such as sorting, filtering, or joining datasets.

### Conclusion
The choice of data structures in pandas depends on the specific needs of your data handling and manipulation tasks. Understanding the benefits of different data structures can help in selecting the most appropriate one for efficient data organization, retrieval, manipulation, and analysis. 

### Example Use Cases:

- **Use a dictionary for key-value pairs** when you need to store and retrieve data with a specific key-value relationship efficiently.
- **Use a list for large datasets** when you need to perform frequent append or indexing operations.
- **Use a dictionary for lookups** when you need to frequently access data by a specific key.
- **Use a DataFrame for data manipulation** when you need to perform operations that require grouping, aggregating, or sorting data.

By considering these factors, you can choose the most suitable data structure for your pandas applications.","<s>[INST] Why is it beneficial to have different data structures in pandas for data handling and manipulation?

### Benefits of Having Different Data Structures in Pandas

1. **Simplified Data Manipulation**:
   - Using different data structures can make it easier to manipulate data in various ways. For example, using a list for sequential data can be straightforward, while using a dictionary for associative data can be more efficient for data that needs to be indexed or looked up.

2. **Flexibility in Data Representation**:
   - Different data structures allow you to represent different types of data in a way that is tailored to the specific use case. For instance, you might use a DataFrame for tabular data, a Series for numerical data, or a dictionary for categorical data.

3. **Efficient Storage and Retrieval**:
   - Choosing the appropriate data structure can significantly affect how data is stored and retrieved. For example, a dictionary can be more memory-efficient for large datasets that need to be indexed, while a list can be more suitable for sequential access.

4. **Easier Debugging and Error Handling**:
   - Using the appropriate data structure can make it easier to identify and handle errors that might arise during data manipulation. For example, if you're using a dictionary to represent a DataFrame, you can more easily retrieve specific columns or rows, which can aid in debugging.

5. **Compatibility with Different Data Sources**:
   - Different data structures can be more compatible with different data sources, such as databases, CSV files, or external libraries. For example, a DataFrame can be easily converted from a SQL database, while a dictionary can be used to store data from a CSV file.

### Example Use Cases:

- **Using a List for Sequential Data**: When working with a list of dates and corresponding values, you might use a list data structure.
- **Using a Dictionary for Associative Data**: When dealing with a dictionary where the keys are column names and the values are data, you can use a dictionary.
- **Using a DataFrame for Tabular Data**: When you need to represent tabular data (e.g., a table with columns and rows), a DataFrame is the most appropriate choice.

### Conclusion:
Choosing the right data structure in pandas is crucial for effective data manipulation and analysis. It can significantly impact the efficiency, readability, and usability of your code, making it easier to work with data in a variety of contexts.","{'overall_score': 8, 'overall_rationale': 'The answer provides a comprehensive overview of why having different data structures in pandas is beneficial, offering clear examples and explanations for each point.

*************************
Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.
Context 2: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.
Context 3: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support
---------------

The first stop for pandas issues and ideas is the `GitHub Issue Tracker
<https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues>`__. If you have a general question,
pandas community experts can answer through `Stack Overflow
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas>`__. Community

*************************
Scaling to large datasets
*************************

pandas provides data structures for in-memory analytics, which makes using pandas
to analyze datasets that are larger than memory datasets somewhat tricky. Even datasets
that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.
Context 2: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.
Context 3: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support

Context 4: * Enables automatic and explicit data alignment. * Allows intuitive getting and setting of subsets of the data set. In this section, we will focus on the final point: namely, how to slice, dice,
and generally get and set subsets of pandas objects. The primary focus will be
on Series and DataFrame as they have received more development attention in
this area. .. note::

   The Python and NumPy indexing operators ``[]`` and attribute operator ``.``
   provide quick and easy access to pandas data structures across a wide range
   of use cases. This makes interactive work intuitive, as there's little new
   to learn if you already know how to deal with Python dictionaries and NumPy
   arrays. However, since the type of the data to be accessed isn't known in
   advance, directly using standard operators has some optimization limits. For
   production code, we recommended that you take advantage of the optimized
   pandas data access methods exposed in this chapter. See the :ref:`MultiIndex / Advanced Indexing <advanced>` for ``MultiIndex`` and more advanced indexing documentation. See the :ref:`cookbook<cookbook.selection>` for some advanced strategies. .. _indexing.choice:

Different choices for indexing
------------------------------

Object selection has had a number of user-requested additions in order to
support more explicit location based indexing. pandas now supports three types
of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*
  semantics).
Context 5: A pandas ``DataFrame`` can be constructed in many different ways,
but for a small number of values, it is often convenient to specify it as
a Python dictionary, where the keys are the column names
and the values are the data. ..

 [/INST] 

### Why is it beneficial to have different data structures in pandas for data handling and manipulation?
In pandas, the choice of data structure (Series, DataFrame, or Panel) heavily depends on the nature of your data and the operations you want to perform. For example, when working with categorical data, a Series is a better choice because it provides a vectorized operation interface, which allows for efficient processing of categorical variables. However, when working with numerical data, a DataFrame is a better choice because it provides a more comprehensive set of tools for data manipulation, including groupby and pivot_table operations.

### What are some examples of different data structures in pandas?
Here are some examples of different data structures in pandas:

#### Series
A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array of values. It is similar to a Python list, but with some additional functionality, such as:
- Vectorized operations: Series support vectorized operations, which means that operations like sum, mean, and count can be applied element-wise to the entire Series, rather than having to iterate over each element individually.
- Indexing and slicing: Series have an index (which can be a Series or a list-like object) and can be sliced using square brackets (e.g., `s[1:3]`).
- Reshaping: Series can be reshaped into a variety of data structures, such as a 1D array or a DataFrame.
- Groupby: Series support groupby operations, which allow you to perform operations on groups of data.

#### DataFrame
A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It is similar to a Python dictionary, but with some additional functionality, such as:
- Indexing and slicing: DataFrames have an index (which can be a Series or a list-like object) and can be sliced using square brackets (e.g., `df[1:3]`).
- Reshaping: DataFrames can be reshaped into a variety of data structures, such as a 1D array or a Panel.
- Groupby: DataFrames support groupby operations, which allow you to perform operations on groups of data.
- Multi-indexing: DataFrames can have multiple index levels.

#### Panel
A Panel is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with multiple columns of potentially different types. It is similar to a Python dictionary, but with some additional functionality, such as:
- Indexing and slicing: Panels have an index (which can be a Series or a list-like object) and can be sliced using square brackets (e.g., `df[1:3]`).
- Reshaping: Panels can be reshaped into a variety of data structures, such as a 1D array or a DataFrame.
- Groupby: Panels support groupby operations, which allow you to perform operations on groups of data.
- Multi-indexing: Panels can have multiple index levels.

### When to use each data structure?
Here are some guidelines on when to use each data structure:

#### Series
Use a Series when:
- You have a single column of data that you want to manipulate or analyze.
- You need to perform vectorized operations on the data.
- You want to preserve the original index.

#### DataFrame
Use a DataFrame when:
- You have a multi-indexed data structure with multiple columns.
- You want to perform groupby operations on the data.
- You want to perform operations on multiple groups of data at once.
- You need to preserve the original index.

#### Panel
Use a Panel when:
- You have a multi-dimensional data structure with multiple columns.
- You want to perform operations on multiple groups of data at once.
- You want to preserve the original index.
- You need to perform operations on multiple groups of data at once.

### Example use cases
Here are some example use cases:

#### Series
Create a Series from a list of values:
```python
import pandas as pd

data = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
s = pd.Series(data)
print(s)
```
Output:
a    a
b    b
c    c
d    d
dtype: object

Create a Series from a list of Series:
```python
data = [pd.Series([1, 2, 3]), pd.Series([4, 5, 6])]
s = pd.Series(data)
print(s)
```
Output:
a    1
b    2
c    3
d    4
dtype: int64

Create a Series from a NumPy array:
```python
import numpy as np

data = np.array(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
s = pd.Series(data)
print(s)
```
Output:
a    a
b    b
c    c
d    d
dtype: object

#### DataFrame
Create a DataFrame from a list of dictionaries:
```python
data = [{'name': 'John', 'age': 30}, {'name': 'Jane', 'age': 25}]
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```
Output:
     name  age
0    John   30
1    Jane   25

Create a DataFrame from a list of Series:
```python
data = [pd.Series([1, 2, 3]), pd.Series([4, 5, 6])]
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```
Output:
     0   1   2
0   1   2   3
1   4   5   6
dtype: int64

Create a DataFrame from a list of NumPy arrays:
```python
data = np.array([['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f']])
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```
Output:
     0     1     2
0    a    b    c
1    d    e    f
dtype: object
```
#### Panel
Create a Panel from a list of dictionaries:
```python
data = [{'name': 'John', 'age': 30}, {'name': 'Jane', 'age': 25}]
df = pd.Panel(data)
print(df)
```
Output:
     name  age
0    John   30
1    Jane   25
dtype: object
```
Create a Panel from a list of Series:
```python
data = [pd.Series([1, 2, 3]), pd.Series([4, 5, 6])]
df = pd.Panel(data)
print(df)
```
Output:
    0  1  2
0  1  2  3
1  4  5  6
dtype: int64
```
Create a Panel from a list of NumPy arrays:
```python
data = np.array([['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f']])
df = pd.Panel(data)
print(df)
```
Output:
     0     1     2
0    a    b    c
1    d    e    f
dtype: object
```
### Tips and Variations
Here are some additional tips and variations:

#### Series and DataFrame
When working with Series and DataFrame, you can use the same indexing and slicing syntax.
When working with a Series, you can use the `iloc` method to access individual elements.
When working with a DataFrame, you can use the `loc` method to access individual rows and columns.

#### Panel
When working with a Panel, you can use the same indexing and slicing syntax.
When working with a Panel, you can use the `iloc` method to access individual elements.
When working with a Panel, you can use the `loc` method to access individual rows and columns.

### Conclusion
In summary, the choice of data structure in pandas depends on the nature of your data and the operations you want to perform. By understanding the differences between Series, DataFrame, and Panel, you can write more efficient and effective code.

### Example use case
Here is an example use case:
Suppose you have a list of dictionaries representing students, each with a name and age. You want to create a DataFrame that shows the average age of students by gender.
```python
import pandas as pd

data = [{'name': 'John', 'age': 20}, {'name': 'Jane', 'age': 22}, {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 21}]
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Group by gender and calculate average age
df_avg_age = df.groupby('name')['age'].mean()
print(df_avg_age)
```
Output:
    name
Bob    21.0
Jane    22.0
John    20.0
dtype: float64

In this example, the DataFrame is used to group the data by name and calculate the average age for each group. The result is a new DataFrame that shows the average age of students by gender.","{'overall_score': 7.5, 'overall_rationale': 'The answer provides a comprehensive overview of why having different data structures in pandas is beneficial, elaborating on the instances to use Series, DataFrame, and Panel, with examples for each.

that are a sizable fraction of memory become unwieldy, as some pandas operations need
to make intermediate copies. This document provides a few recommendations for scaling your analysis to larger datasets. It's a complement to :ref:`enhancingperf`, which focuses on speeding up analysis
for datasets that fit in memory. Load less data
--------------

Suppose our raw dataset on disk has many columns. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   def make_timeseries(start=""2000-01-01"", end=""2000-12-31"", freq=""1D"", seed=None):
       index = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq=freq, name=""timestamp"")
       n = len(index)
       state = np.random.RandomState(seed)
       columns = {
           ""name"": state.choice([""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie""], size=n),
           ""id"": state.poisson(1000, size=n),
           ""x"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
           ""y"": state.rand(n) * 2 - 1,
       }
       df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=index, columns=sorted(columns))
       if df.index[-1] == end:
           df = df.iloc[:-1]
       return df

   timeseries = [
       make_timeseries(freq=""1min"", seed=i).rename(columns=lambda x: f""{x}_{i}"")
       for i in range(10)
   ]
   ts_wide = pd.concat(timeseries, axis=1)
   ts_wide.head()
   ts_wide.to_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

To load the columns we want, we have two options. Option 1 loads in all the data and then filters to what we need. .. ipython:: python

   columns = [""id_0"", ""name_0"", ""x_0"", ""y_0""]

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")[columns]

Option 2 only loads the columns we request. .. ipython:: python

   pd.read_parquet(""timeseries_wide.parquet"", columns=columns)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   import os

   os.remove(""timeseries_wide.parquet"")

If we were to measure the memory usage of the two calls, we'd see that specifying
``columns`` uses about 1/10th the memory in this case. With :func:`pandas.read_csv`, you can specify ``usecols`` to limit the columns
read into memory. Not all file formats that can be read by pandas provide an option
to read a subset of columns. Use efficient datatypes
-----------------------

The default pandas data types are not the most memory efficient. This is
especially true for text data columns with relatively few unique values (commonly
referred to as ""low-cardinality"" data). By using more efficient data types, you
can store larger datasets in memory. .. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   ts = make_timeseries(freq=""30s"", seed=0)
   ts.to_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts = pd.read_parquet(""timeseries.parquet"")
   ts

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   os.remove(""timeseries.parquet"")

Now, let's inspect the data types and memory usage to see where we should focus our
attention. .. ipython:: python

   ts.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts.memory_usage(deep=True)  # memory usage in bytes


The ``name`` column is taking up much more memory than any other. It has just a
few unique values, so it's a good candidate for converting to a
:class:`pandas.Categorical`. With a :class:`pandas.Categorical`, we store each unique name once and use
space-efficient integers to know which specific name is used in each row. .. ipython:: python

   ts2 = ts.copy()
   ts2[""name""] = ts2[""name""].astype(""category"")
   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

We can go a bit further and downcast the numeric columns to their smallest types
using :func:`pandas.to_numeric`. .. ipython:: python

   ts2[""id""] = pd.to_numeric(ts2[""id""], downcast=""unsigned"")
   ts2[[""x"", ""y""]] = ts2[[""x"", ""y""]].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast=""float"")
   ts2.dtypes

.. ipython:: python

   ts2.memory_usage(deep=True)

.. ipython:: python

   reduction = ts2.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ts.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()
   print(f""{reduction:0.2f}"")

In all, we've reduced the in-memory footprint of this dataset to 1/5 of its
original size. See :ref:`categorical` for more on :class:`pandas.Categorical` and :ref:`basics.dtypes`
for an overview of all of pandas' dtypes. Use chunking
------------

Some workloads can be achieved with chunking by splitting a large problem into a bunch of small problems. For example,
converting an individual CSV file into a Parquet file and repeating that for each file in a directory. As long as each chunk
fits in memory, you can work with datasets that are much larger than memory. .. note::

   Chunking works well when the operation you're performing requires zero or minimal
   coordination between chunks. For more complicated workflows, you're better off
   :ref:`using other libraries <scale.other_libraries>`. Suppose we have an even larger ""logical dataset"" on disk that's a directory of parquet
files. Each file in the directory represents a different year of the entire dataset.
Context 2: For data
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas
is the ideal tool for all of these tasks. Some other notes

 - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been
   extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with
   anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance.
Context 3: So if you focus
   on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster
   specialized tool. - pandas is a dependency of `statsmodels
   <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__, making it an important part of the
   statistical computing ecosystem in Python. - pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications. Data structures
---------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: ""Dimensions"", ""Name"", ""Description""
    :widths: 15, 20, 50

    1, ""Series"", ""1D labeled homogeneously-typed array""
    2, ""DataFrame"", ""General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column""

Why more than one data structure? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible
containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container
for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be
able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like
fashion. Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions
which take into account the typical orientation of time series and
cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional
data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data
set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except
when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes
are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular
data set, there is likely to be a ""right"" way to orient the data. The goal,
then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data
transformations in downstream functions. For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to
think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and
axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more
readable code:

::

    for col in df.columns:
        series = df[col]
        # do something with series

Mutability and copying of data
------------------------------

All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be
altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be
changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However,
the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data
untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible. Getting support
---------------

The first stop for pandas issues and ideas is the `GitHub Issue Tracker
<https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues>`__. If you have a general question,
pandas community experts can answer through `Stack Overflow

Context 4: * Enables automatic and explicit data alignment. * Allows intuitive getting and setting of subsets of the data set. In this section, we will focus on the final point: namely, how to slice, dice,
and generally get and set subsets of pandas objects. The primary focus will be
on Series and DataFrame as they have received more development attention in
this area. .. note::

   The Python and NumPy indexing operators ``[]`` and attribute operator ``.``
   provide quick and easy access to pandas data structures across a wide range
   of use cases. This makes interactive work intuitive, as there's little new
   to learn if you already know how to deal with Python dictionaries and NumPy
   arrays. However, since the type of the data to be accessed isn't known in
   advance, directly using standard operators has some optimization limits. For
   production code, we recommended that you take advantage of the optimized
   pandas data access methods exposed in this chapter. See the :ref:`MultiIndex / Advanced Indexing <advanced>` for ``MultiIndex`` and more advanced indexing documentation. See the :ref:`cookbook<cookbook.selection>` for some advanced strategies. .. _indexing.choice:

Different choices for indexing
------------------------------

Object selection has had a number of user-requested additions in order to
support more explicit location based indexing. pandas now supports three types
of multi-axis indexing. * ``.loc`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. ``.loc`` will raise ``KeyError`` when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:

    * A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'`` (Note that ``5`` is interpreted as a
      *label* of the index. This use is **not** an integer position along the
      index.). * A list or array of labels ``['a', 'b', 'c']``. * A slice object with labels ``'a':'f'`` (Note that contrary to usual Python
      slices, **both** the start and the stop are included, when present in the
      index! See :ref:`Slicing with labels <indexing.slicing_with_labels>`
      and :ref:`Endpoints are inclusive <advanced.endpoints_are_inclusive>`.)
    * A boolean array (any ``NA`` values will be treated as ``False``). * A ``callable`` function with one argument (the calling Series or DataFrame) and
      that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above). * A tuple of row (and column) indices whose elements are one of the
      above inputs. See more at :ref:`Selection by Label <indexing.label>`. * ``.iloc`` is primarily integer position based (from ``0`` to
  ``length-1`` of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean
  array. ``.iloc`` will raise ``IndexError`` if a requested
  indexer is out-of-bounds, except *slice* indexers which allow
  out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with Python/NumPy *slice*
  semantics).
Context 5: A pandas ``DataFrame`` can be constructed in many different ways,
but for a small number of values, it is often convenient to specify it as
a Python dictionary, where the keys are the column names
and the values are the data. ..
 [/INST]





<p>When you have a DataFrame, you can use the <code>loc</code> accessor to select
specific rows and columns. The <code>loc</code> accessor is similar to the
<code>iloc</code> accessor, but it allows you to select rows based on a label
or index value. This is useful when you have a DataFrame with a large number of
rows and columns, but you only want to select a few rows based on a label.
For example, suppose you have a DataFrame with the following columns:
<p> <code>Index</code> <code>Value</code></code>
<p> <code>0</code> <code>1</code></code>
<p> <code>1</code> <code>2</code></code>

Context 2: 1. **Thank the reporter for opening an issue**

   The issue tracker is many people's first interaction with the pandas project itself,
   beyond just using the library. As such, we want it to be a welcoming, pleasant
   experience. 2. **Is the necessary information provided?**

   Ideally reporters would fill out the issue template, but many don't. If crucial information (like the version of pandas they used), is missing
   feel free to ask for that and label the issue with ""Needs info"". The
   report should follow the guidelines in :ref:`contributing.bug_reports`. You may want to link to that if they didn't follow the template. Make sure that the title accurately reflects the issue. Edit it yourself
   if it's not clear. 3. **Is this a duplicate issue?**

   We have many open issues. If a new issue is clearly a duplicate, label the
   new issue as ""Duplicate"" and close the issue with a link to the original issue. Make sure to still thank the reporter, and encourage them to chime in on the
   original issue, and perhaps try to fix it. If the new issue provides relevant information, such as a better or slightly
   different example, add it to the original issue as a comment or an edit to
   the original post. 4. **Is the issue minimal and reproducible**? For bug reports, we ask that the reporter provide a minimal reproducible
   example. See https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports
   for a good explanation. If the example is not reproducible, or if it's
   *clearly* not minimal, feel free to ask the reporter if they can provide
   an example or simplify the provided one. Do acknowledge that writing
   minimal reproducible examples is hard work. If the reporter is struggling,
   you can try to write one yourself and we'll edit the original post to include it. If a reproducible example can't be provided, add the ""Needs info"" label. If a reproducible example is provided, but you see a simplification,
   edit the original post with your simpler reproducible example. If this is a regression report, post the result of a ``git bisect`` run. More info on this can be found in the :ref:`maintaining.regressions` section. Ensure the issue exists on the main branch and that it has the ""Needs Triage"" tag
   until all steps have been completed. Add a comment to the issue once you have
   verified it exists on the main branch, so others know it has been confirmed. 5. **Is this a clearly defined feature request?**

   Generally, pandas prefers to discuss and design new features in issues, before
   a pull request is made. Encourage the submitter to include a proposed API
   for the new feature. Having them write a full docstring is a good way to
   pin down specifics. Tag new feature requests with ""Needs Discussion"", as we'll need a discussion
   from several pandas maintainers before deciding whether the proposal is in
   scope for pandas. 6. **Is this a usage question?**

   We prefer that usage questions are asked on StackOverflow with the pandas
   tag. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas

   If it's easy to answer, feel free to link to the relevant documentation section,
   let them know that in the future this kind of question should be on
   StackOverflow, and close the issue. 7. **What labels and milestones should I add?**

   Apply the relevant labels. This is a bit of an art, and comes with experience.

   We are proud to announce that *pandas* has become a sponsored project of the (`NumFOCUS organization`_). This will help ensure the success of development of *pandas* as a world-class open-source project. .. _numfocus organization: http://www.numfocus.org/blog/numfocus-announces-new-fiscally-sponsored-project-pandas

This is a minor bug-fix release from 0.17.0 and includes a large number of
bug fixes along several new features, enhancements, and performance improvements. We recommend that all users upgrade to this version. Highlights include:

- Support for Conditional HTML Formatting, see :ref:`here <whatsnew_0171.style>`
- Releasing the GIL on the csv reader & other ops, see :ref:`here <whatsnew_0171.performance>`
- Fixed regression in ``DataFrame.drop_duplicates`` from 0.16.2, causing incorrect results on integer values (:issue:`11376`)

Conditional HTML formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::
    This is a new feature and is under active development. We'll be adding features an  possibly making breaking changes in future
    releases. Feedback is welcome in :issue:`11610`

We've added *experimental* support for conditional HTML formatting:
the visual styling of a DataFrame based on the data. The styling is accomplished with HTML and CSS. Accesses the styler class with the :attr:`pandas.DataFrame.style`, attribute,
an instance of :class:`.Styler` with your data attached. Here's a quick example:

  .. ipython:: python

    np.random.seed(123)
    df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 5), columns=list(""abcde""))
    html = df.style.background_gradient(cmap=""viridis"", low=0.5)

We can render the HTML to get the following table. .. raw:: html

==========
User Guide
==========

The User Guide covers all of pandas by topic area. Each of the subsections
introduces a topic (such as ""working with missing data""), and discusses how
pandas approaches the problem, with many examples throughout. Users brand-new to pandas should start with :ref:`10min`. For a high level summary of the pandas fundamentals, see :ref:`dsintro` and :ref:`basics`. Further information on any specific method can be obtained in the
:ref:`api`. How to read these guides
------------------------
In these guides you will see input code inside code blocks such as:

::

    import pandas as pd
    pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3]})


or:

.. ipython:: python

    import pandas as pd
    pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3]})

The first block is a standard python input, while in the second the ``In [1]:`` indicates the input is inside a `notebook <https://jupyter.org>`__. In Jupyter Notebooks the last line is printed and plots are shown inline. For example:

","<s>[INST] What is the process for seeking support or getting involved with the pandas community?
 [/INST]""]

The question provides an example of how to use the `s` attribute in a string, along with a brief explanation of how to seek support or get involved with the pandas community. This is a relevant example in the context of using the `s` attribute in a context that may involve seeking help or participating in discussions related to pandas. 

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Question**: The question is structured in a way that it presents a specific scenario involving the `s` attribute and relates it to seeking support or involvement in the pandas community.

2. **Context of the Question**: The context is not explicitly stated, but the question is framed within a larger discussion about pandas, suggesting that it is part of a tutorial, documentation, or a Q&A session where the `s` attribute might be used in a specific way.

3. **Answer Format**: The question is answered in a format that includes a brief example and a clear explanation.

4. **Example Answer**: 
   - **Example**: In a programming context, if one were to use the `s` attribute on a pandas Series, it might refer to seeking support or getting involved with the pandas community. 
   - **Explanation**: The example could illustrate how to use the `s` attribute to access the `support` method of a pandas Series, which would yield a list of available resources or support options for the pandas community. 

5. **Conclusion**: The question is designed to encourage a specific scenario or context, and the answer aims to provide a concrete example and explanation relevant to the question's parameters.

### Code Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a pandas Series
s = pd.Series(s, s=""Hello, World!"")

# Accessing the s attribute to get support
support = s.s
print(support)  # Output: ['s','support', 'get', 'pandas', 'help']
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `s` attribute on a pandas Series and then access the `s` attribute to get a list of available support resources.

Context 2: 1. **Thank the reporter for opening an issue**

   The issue tracker is many people's first interaction with the pandas project itself,
   beyond just using the library. As such, we want it to be a welcoming, pleasant
   experience. 2. **Is the necessary information provided?**

   Ideally reporters would fill out the issue template, but many don't. If crucial information (like the version of pandas they used), is missing
   feel free to ask for that and label the issue with ""Needs info"". The
   report should follow the guidelines in :ref:`contributing.bug_reports`. You may want to link to that if they didn't follow the template. Make sure that the title accurately reflects the issue. Edit it yourself
   if it's not clear. 3. **Is this a duplicate issue?**

   We have many open issues. If a new issue is clearly a duplicate, label the
   new issue as ""Duplicate"" and close the issue with a link to the original issue. Make sure to still thank the reporter, and encourage them to chime in on the
   original issue, and perhaps try to fix it. If the new issue provides relevant information, such as a better or slightly
   different example, add it to the original issue as a comment or an edit to
   the original post. 4. **Is the issue minimal and reproducible**? For bug reports, we ask that the reporter provide a minimal reproducible
   example. See https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports
   for a good explanation. If the example is not reproducible, or if it's
   *clearly* not minimal, feel free to ask the reporter if they can provide
   an example or simplify the provided one. Do acknowledge that writing
   minimal reproducible examples is hard work. If the reporter is struggling,
   you can try to write one yourself and we'll edit the original post to include it. If a reproducible example can't be provided, add the ""Needs info"" label. If a reproducible example is provided, but you see a simplification,
   edit the original post with your simpler reproducible example. If this is a regression report, post the result of a ``git bisect`` run. More info on this can be found in the :ref:`maintaining.regressions` section. Ensure the issue exists on the main branch and that it has the ""Needs Triage"" tag
   until all steps have been completed. Add a comment to the issue once you have
   verified it exists on the main branch, so others know it has been confirmed. 5. **Is this a clearly defined feature request?**

   Generally, pandas prefers to discuss and design new features in issues, before
   a pull request is made. Encourage the submitter to include a proposed API
   for the new feature. Having them write a full docstring is a good way to
   pin down specifics. Tag new feature requests with ""Needs Discussion"", as we'll need a discussion
   from several pandas maintainers before deciding whether the proposal is in
   scope for pandas. 6. **Is this a usage question?**

   We prefer that usage questions are asked on StackOverflow with the pandas
   tag. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas

   If it's easy to answer, feel free to link to the relevant documentation section,
   let them know that in the future this kind of question should be on
   StackOverflow, and close the issue. 7. **What labels and milestones should I add?**

   Apply the relevant labels. This is a bit of an art, and comes with experience.

.. note::

   We are proud to announce that *pandas* has become a sponsored project of the (`NumFOCUS organization`_). This will help ensure the success of development of *pandas* as a world-class open-source project. .. _numfocus organization: http://www.numfocus.org/blog/numfocus-announces-new-fiscally-sponsored-project-pandas

This is a minor bug-fix release from 0.17.0 and includes a large number of
bug fixes along several new features, enhancements, and performance improvements. We recommend that all users upgrade to this version. Highlights include:

- Support for Conditional HTML Formatting, see :ref:`here <whatsnew_0171.style>`
- Releasing the GIL on the csv reader & other ops, see :ref:`here <whatsnew_0171.performance>`
- Fixed regression in ``DataFrame.drop_duplicates`` from 0.16.2, causing incorrect results on integer values (:issue:`11376`)

Conditional HTML formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::
    This is a new feature and is under active development. We'll be adding features an  possibly making breaking changes in future
    releases. Feedback is welcome in :issue:`11610`

We've added *experimental* support for conditional HTML formatting:
the visual styling of a DataFrame based on the data. The styling is accomplished with HTML and CSS. Accesses the styler class with the :attr:`pandas.DataFrame.style`, attribute,
an instance of :class:`.Styler` with your data attached. Here's a quick example:

  .. ipython:: python

    np.random.seed(123)
    df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 5), columns=list(""abcde""))
    html = df.style.background_gradient(cmap=""viridis"", low=0.5)

We can render the HTML to get the following table. .. raw:: html
   :file: whatsnew_0171_html_table.html

:class:`.Styler` interacts nicely with the Jupyter Notebook. See the :ref:`documentation </user_guide/style.ipynb>` for more. .. _whatsnew_0171.enhancements:

- Added ``axvlines_kwds`` to parallel coordinates plot (:issue:`10709`)
- Option to ``.info()`` and ``.memory_usage()`` to provide for deep introspection of memory consumption. Note that this can be expensive to compute and therefore is an optional parameter. (:issue:`11595`)

  .. ipython:: python

     df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": [""foo""] * 1000})  # noqa: F821
     df[""B""] = df[""A""].astype(""category"")

     # shows the '+' as we have object dtypes
     df.info()

     # we have an accurate memory assessment (but can be expensive to compute this)
     df.info(memory_usage=""deep"")

     date
     date.dt.day

- ``pivot_table`` now has a ``margins_name`` argument so you can use something other than the default of 'All' (:issue:`3335`)
- Implement export of ``datetime64[ns, tz]`` dtypes with a fixed HDF5 store (:issue:`11411`)
- Pretty printing sets (e.g. in DataFrame cells) now uses set literal syntax (``{x, y}``) instead of

Context 2: 1. **Thank the reporter for opening an issue**

   The issue tracker is many people's first interaction with the pandas project itself,
   beyond just using the library. As such, we want it to be a welcoming, pleasant
   experience. 2. **Is the necessary information provided?**

   Ideally reporters would fill out the issue template, but many don't. If crucial information (like the version of pandas they used), is missing
   feel free to ask for that and label the issue with ""Needs info"". The
   report should follow the guidelines in :ref:`contributing.bug_reports`. You may want to link to that if they didn't follow the template. Make sure that the title accurately reflects the issue. Edit it yourself
   if it's not clear. 3. **Is this a duplicate issue?**

   We have many open issues. If a new issue is clearly a duplicate, label the
   new issue as ""Duplicate"" and close the issue with a link to the original issue. Make sure to still thank the reporter, and encourage them to chime in on the
   original issue, and perhaps try to fix it. If the new issue provides relevant information, such as a better or slightly
   different example, add it to the original issue as a comment or an edit to
   the original post. 4. **Is the issue minimal and reproducible**? For bug reports, we ask that the reporter provide a minimal reproducible
   example. See https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports
   for a good explanation. If the example is not reproducible, or if it's
   *clearly* not minimal, feel free to ask the reporter if they can provide
   an example or simplify the provided one. Do acknowledge that writing
   minimal reproducible examples is hard work. If the reporter is struggling,
   you can try to write one yourself and we'll edit the original post to include it. If a reproducible example can't be provided, add the ""Needs info"" label. If a reproducible example is provided, but you see a simplification,
   edit the original post with your simpler reproducible example. If this is a regression report, post the result of a ``git bisect`` run. More info on this can be found in the :ref:`maintaining.regressions` section. Ensure the issue exists on the main branch and that it has the ""Needs Triage"" tag
   until all steps have been completed. Add a comment to the issue once you have
   verified it exists on the main branch, so others know it has been confirmed. 5. **Is this a clearly defined feature request?**

   Generally, pandas prefers to discuss and design new features in issues, before
   a pull request is made. Encourage the submitter to include a proposed API
   for the new feature. Having them write a full docstring is a good way to
   pin down specifics. Tag new feature requests with ""Needs Discussion"", as we'll need a discussion
   from several pandas maintainers before deciding whether the proposal is in
   scope for pandas. 6. **Is this a usage question?**

   We prefer that usage questions are asked on StackOverflow with the pandas
   tag. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas

   If it's easy to answer, feel free to link to the relevant documentation section,
   let them know that in the future this kind of question should be on
   StackOverflow, and close the issue. 7. **What labels and milestones should I add?**

   Apply the relevant labels. This is a bit of an art, and comes with experience.
Context 3: .. _whatsnew_0171:

Version 0.17.1 (November 21, 2015)
----------------------------------

{{ header }}


.. note::

   We are proud to announce that *pandas* has become a sponsored project of the (`NumFOCUS organization`_). This will help ensure the success of development of *pandas* as a world-class open-source project. .. _numfocus organization: http://www.numfocus.org/blog/numfocus-announces-new-fiscally-sponsored-project-pandas

This is a minor bug-fix release from 0.17.0 and includes a large number of
bug fixes along several new features, enhancements, and performance improvements. We recommend that all users upgrade to this version. Highlights include:

- Support for Conditional HTML Formatting, see :ref:`here <whatsnew_0171.style>`
- Releasing the GIL on the csv reader & other ops, see :ref:`here <whatsnew_0171.performance>`
- Fixed regression in ``DataFrame.drop_duplicates`` from 0.16.2, causing incorrect results on integer values (:issue:`11376`)

.. _whatsnew_0171.style:

Conditional HTML formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::
    This is a new feature and is under active development. We'll be adding features an  possibly making breaking changes in future
    releases. Feedback is welcome in :issue:`11610`

We've added *experimental* support for conditional HTML formatting:
the visual styling of a DataFrame based on the data. The styling is accomplished with HTML and CSS. Accesses the styler class with the :attr:`pandas.DataFrame.style`, attribute,
an instance of :class:`.Styler` with your data attached. Here's a quick example:

  .. ipython:: python

    np.random.seed(123)
    df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 5), columns=list(""abcde""))
    html = df.style.background_gradient(cmap=""viridis"", low=0.5)

We can render the HTML to get the following table. .. raw:: html
   :file: whatsnew_0171_html_table.html

:class:`.Styler` interacts nicely with the Jupyter Notebook. See the :ref:`documentation </user_guide/style.ipynb>` for more. .. _whatsnew_0171.enhancements:

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``DatetimeIndex`` now supports conversion to strings with ``astype(str)`` (:issue:`10442`)
- Support for ``compression`` (gzip/bz2) in :meth:`pandas.DataFrame.to_csv` (:issue:`7615`)
- ``pd.read_*`` functions can now also accept :class:`python:pathlib.Path`, or :class:`py:py._path.local.LocalPath`
  objects for the ``filepath_or_buffer`` argument. (:issue:`11033`)
  - The ``DataFrame`` and ``Series`` functions ``.to_csv()``, ``.to_html()`` and ``.to_latex()`` can now handle paths beginning with tildes (e.g. ``~/Documents/``) (:issue:`11438`)
- ``DataFrame`` now uses the fields of a ``namedtuple`` as columns, if columns are not supplied (:issue:`11181`)
- ``DataFrame.itertuples()`` now returns ``namedtuple`` objects, when possible. (:issue:`11269`, :issue:`11625`)
- Added ``axvlines_kwds`` to parallel coordinates plot (:issue:`10709`)
- Option to ``.info()`` and ``.memory_usage()`` to provide for deep introspection of memory consumption. Note that this can be expensive to compute and therefore is an optional parameter. (:issue:`11595`)

  .. ipython:: python

     df = pd.DataFrame({""A"": [""foo""] * 1000})  # noqa: F821
     df[""B""] = df[""A""].astype(""category"")

     # shows the '+' as we have object dtypes
     df.info()

     # we have an accurate memory assessment (but can be expensive to compute this)
     df.info(memory_usage=""deep"")

- ``Index`` now has a ``fillna`` method (:issue:`10089`)

  .. ipython:: python

     pd.Index([1, np.nan, 3]).fillna(2)

- Series of type ``category`` now make ``.str.<...>`` and ``.dt.<...>`` accessor methods / properties available, if the categories are of that type. (:issue:`10661`)

  .. ipython:: python

     s = pd.Series(list(""aabb"")).astype(""category"")
     s
     s.str.contains(""a"")

     date = pd.Series(pd.date_range(""1/1/2015"", periods=5)).astype(""category"")
     date
     date.dt.day

- ``pivot_table`` now has a ``margins_name`` argument so you can use something other than the default of 'All' (:issue:`3335`)
- Implement export of ``datetime64[ns, tz]`` dtypes with a fixed HDF5 store (:issue:`11411`)
- Pretty printing sets (e.g. in DataFrame cells) now uses set literal syntax (``{x, y}``) instead of
  Legacy Python syntax (``set([x, y])``) (:issue:`11215`)
- Improve the error message in :func:`pandas.io.gbq.to_gbq` when a streaming insert fails (:issue:`11285`)
  and when the DataFrame does not match the schema of the destination table (:issue:`11359`)

.. _whatsnew_0171.api:

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- raise ``NotImplementedError`` in ``Index.shift`` for non-supported index types (:issue:`8038`)
- ``min`` and ``max`` reductions on ``datetime64`` and ``timedelta64`` dtyped series now
  result in ``NaT`` and not ``nan`` (:issue:`11245`). - Indexing with a null key will raise a ``TypeError``, instead of a ``ValueError`` (:issue:`11356`)
- ``Series.ptp`` will now ignore missing values by default (:issue:`11163`)

.. _whatsnew_0171.deprecations:

Deprecations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The ``pandas.io.ga`` module which implements ``google-analytics`` support is deprecated and will be removed in a future version (:issue:`11308`)
- Deprecate the ``engine`` keyword in ``.to_csv()``, which will be removed in a future version (:issue:`11274`)

.. _whatsnew_0171.performance:

Performance improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Checking monotonic-ness before sorting on an index (:issue:`11080`)
- ``Series.dropna`` performance improvement when its dtype can't contain ``NaN`` (:issue:`11159`)
- Release the GIL on most datetime field operations (e.g.

Maintainers and frequent contributors might also open issues to discuss the
ongoing development of the project. For example:

- Report issues with the CI, GitHub Actions, or the performance of pandas
- Open issues relating to the internals
- Start roadmap discussion aligning on proposals for what to do in future
  releases or changes to the API. - Open issues relating to the project's website, logo, or governance

The developer mailing list
--------------------------

The pandas mailing list `pandas-dev@python.org <mailto://pandas-dev@python
.org>`_ is used for long form
conversations and to engage people in the wider community who might not
be active on the issue tracker but we would like to include in discussions. Join the mailing list and view the archives `here <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pandas-dev>`_. .. _community.slack:

Community slack
---------------

We have a chat platform for contributors, maintainers and potential
contributors. This is not a space for user questions, rather for questions about
contributing to pandas. The slack is a private space, specifically meant for
people who are hesitant to bring up their questions or ideas on a large public
mailing list or GitHub. If this sounds like the right place for you, you are welcome to join using
`this link <https://join.slack.com/t/pandas-dev-community/shared_invite/zt-2blg6u9k3-K6_XvMRDZWeH7Id274UeIg>`_! Please remember to follow our `Code of Conduct <https://pandas.pydata.org/community/coc.html>`_,
and be aware that our admins are monitoring for irrelevant messages and will remove folks who use
our
slack for spam, advertisements and messages not related to the pandas contributing community. And
please remember that slack is not meant to replace the mailing list or issue tracker - all important
announcements and conversations should still happen there.

.. _user_guide:

==========
User Guide
==========

The User Guide covers all of pandas by topic area. Each of the subsections
introduces a topic (such as ""working with missing data""), and discusses how
pandas approaches the problem, with many examples throughout. Users brand-new to pandas should start with :ref:`10min`. For a high level summary of the pandas fundamentals, see :ref:`dsintro` and :ref:`basics`. Further information on any specific method can be obtained in the
:ref:`api`. How to read these guides
------------------------
In these guides you will see input code inside code blocks such as:

::

    import pandas as pd
    pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3]})


or:

.. ipython:: python

    import pandas as pd
    pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3]})

The first block is a standard python input, while in the second the ``In [1]:`` indicates the input is inside a `notebook <https://jupyter.org>`__. In Jupyter Notebooks the last line is printed and plots are shown inline. For example:

..

However, it includes valuable information that could guide someone interested in community engagement.', 'grammar_score': 6.0, 'grammar_rationale': 'The grammar is generally correct, with well-constructed sentences and appropriate punctuation.

However, it lacks clear steps or actionable advice on how an individual can seek support or get involved, which hinders the logical flow of the answer."", 'relevance_score': 4.0, 'relevance_rationale': ""The content has some relevance as it touches on aspects of the pandas community, like contributor meetings, but it fails to directly and succinctly answer the specific question posed. The inclusion of detailed context not specifically addressing the main question can detract from the response's relevance.""}"
